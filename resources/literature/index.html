    <blockquote>
      <p>the findings are presented as two parts of a whole, the first being the conceptual framework that describes a set of essential factors that an ecosystem requires in order to fulfill the goals of self-sovereign identity and interoperability. The second is a set of visualizations of how the framework can be used to design systems and interactions, inside and between the systems, to create an ecosystem.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Verifiable credentials and digital wallets offer a convenient, secure, and privacy-oriented alternative to current physical and digital identity management systems. A recent example – COVID-19 vaccination certificates – highlights this. The verification of paper-based vaccination certificates is often error-prone and time-consuming, especially when many certificates have to be verified in a short period of time, e.g., at a football match or when boarding a plane. Moreover, to establish a sufficient level of authenticity, paper-based vaccination certificates are typically disclosed with additional personal information and identity documents, such as a physical ID card. This requirement to disclose a considerable amount of personal information raises privacy concerns, it is inconvenient, and it increases the total verification time.</p>

      <p>This study presents a rigorous systematic mapping and systematic literature review covering theoretical and practical advances in Self-Sovereign Identity.

    <blockquote>
      <p>The results suggest that validation research and solution proposals prevail, addressing decentralized identity in a general matter. Papers mainly propose systems/solutions, architectures, and frameworks, focusing on authentication, security, privacy, and trust, while there are hardly any studies researching usability, user experience, patterns, and good practices.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>This paper addresses the role of digital identities for a functioning digital economy and outlines requirements for their management. […] The concept of Self-Sovereign Identities (SSI) and the associated standards “Verifiable Credentials” and “Decentralized Identifiers” is a promising approach to improve the situation. They allow the flexible exchange of tamper-proof digital proofs between users and systems. Therefore, they form the foundation for building trust relationships in the digital space. This paper introduces the SSI paradigm and discusses the barriers that prevent the wide-scale adoption of this concept.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>I identify a series of competing logics in the debates around SSI’s emancipatory potential, which relate to four issues: (i) the neutrality of the technology, (ii) the capacities of refugees, (iii) global governance and the nation state, and (iv) new economic models for digital identity. SSI is simultaneously the potential enabler of new modes of empowerment, autonomy and data security for refugees and a means of maintaining and extending bureaucratic and commercial power.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Modelling self-sovereign identity systems seeks to provide stakeholders and software architects with tools to enable them to communicate effectively, and lead to effective and well-regarded system designs and implementations. This paper draws upon research from Actor-based Modelling to guide a way forward in modelling self-sovereign systems, and reports early success in utilising the iStar 2.0 framework to provide a representation of a birth registration case study.</p>

if you want understand the history of self-sovereign intellectual ideas its a good read.
    <blockquote>
      <p>A key aim of this paper then, is to bring a discussion that must be (but currently is not) taking place in an academic context, due to its inherent multidisciplinary nature and complexities, into that particular realm of debate. This ‘history of self-sovereignty’, thus can be read as an experimental discourse analysis that discerns the contemporary usage of the concept</p>

      <p>This thesis proposes a conceptual framework for the design of an ecosystem that supports self-sovereign identity. The research reviews theory, methodology, and technology from subjects such as design, identity, and distributed systems. Through the design process, a set of elements and functions supporting interactions within an ecosystem were developed. The design is revolved around the ideas of privacy, security, distribution, and interoperability. The findings are presented as two parts of a whole, the first being the conceptual framework that describes a set of essential factors that an ecosystem requires in order to fulfill the goals of self-sovereign identity and interoperability. The second is a set of visualizations of how the framework can be used to design systems and interactions, inside and between the systems, to create an ecosystem.</p>

      <p>The components of SSI will be described in detail, evaluated, and visualized in a components architecture. These include standards like decentralized identifiers (DIDs), verifiable credentials (VCs), and verifiable presentations (VPs). Further, the concepts of a decentralized public key infrastructure (DPKI) and a decentralized key management system (DKMS) are introduced. Additionally, this thesis deals in detail with the trust infrastructure of SSI.</p>

      <p>Additionally, this thesis focuses on SSI systems and their underlying DID methods. To provide an overview of existing identity systems, the SSI ecosystem is analyzed on its currently existing DID methods. Based on the presented DID methods, representative DID methods are selected and examined for further analysis and evaluation of the system. To analyze the DID methods and their systems, criteria are defined to emphasize the differences of each DID method. The results from the analysis are then used for evaluating the DID methods.</p>

      <p>The emergence of distributed ledger technology (DLT) based upon a blockchain data structure, has given rise to new approaches to identity management that aim to upend dominant approaches to providing and consuming digital identities. These new approaches to identity management (IdM) propose to enhance decentralisation, transparency and user control in transactions that involve identity information; but, given the historical challenge to design IdM, can these new DLTbased schemes deliver on their lofty goals? We introduce the emerging landscape of DLT-based IdM, and evaluate three representative proposals – uPort, ShoCard and Sovrin – using the analytic lens of a seminal framework that characterises the nature of successful IdM schemes</p>

Since these schemes are not quantum-resistant, we select as one of the possible post-quantum alternatives a lattice-based scheme proposed by Jeudy, Roux-Langlois, and Sander, and we try to identify the open problems for achieving VCs suitable for selective disclosure, non-interactive renewal mechanisms, and efficient revocation.</p>

      <p>The interconnectedness of people, services and devices is a defining aspect of the digital revolution, and, secure digital identities are an important prerequisite for secure and legally compliant information exchange. Existing approaches to realize a secure identity management focus on central providers of identities such as national authorities or online service providers. Hence, changing residence or service provider often means to start over and creating new identities, because procedures for data portability are missing. Self-sovereign digital identities are instead created and managed by individuals, and enable them to maintain their digital identities independent from residence, national eID infrastructure and market-dominating service providers.</p>

Also, the companies themselves could outsource their Customer Due Diligence (CDD) this way to lower costs and make fewer errors.

Instead, users should own and control their data without compromising security or limiting companies’ and authorities’ ability to provide personalized services. Our platform enables this by combining a blockchain, re-purposed as an access-control moderator, with an off-blockchain storage solution. Users are not required to trust any third-party and are always aware of the data that is being collected about them and how it is used. In addition, the blockchain recognizes the users as the owners of their personal data. Companies, in turn, can focus on utilizing data without being overly concerned about properly securing and compartmentalizing them.</p>

      <p>There are many methods for establishing identity without using certificates from trusted certification authorities. The relationship between verifier and subject guides the choice of method. Many of these relationships have easy, straight-forward methods for binding a public key to an identity, using a broadcast channel or 1:1 meetings, but one relationship makes it especially difficult. That relationship is one with an old friend with whom you had lost touch but who appears now to be available on the net. You make contact and share a few exchanges which suggest to you that this is, indeed, your old friend. Then you want to form a secure channel in order to carry on a more extensive conversation in private. This case is subject to the man-in-the-middle attack. For this case, a protocol is presented which binds a pair of identities to a pair of public keys without using any certificates issued by a trusted CA.</p>
