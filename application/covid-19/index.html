    <blockquote>
      <p>My poster looks at a sweet spot in digital vaccine certificates. Too little identity and proof of vaccination is insecure; too much identity and the proof threatens privacy.</p>

      <p>To set the scene, it worries me that COVID vaccination is seen by some as the killer application for exotic technology or digital ideology. We should not impose these sorts of changes onto health systems especially in developing countries. They disrupt established ways of managing patients and they’re not necessary for privacy.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Health passes, though, are much more flexible as they provide multiple options. They can still be used as proof of vaccination, if the user chooses to share their health information in this way.</p>

      <p>But, importantly and in a crucial difference from vaccine passports, they can also be used to securely display a test result, such as a negative PCR or rapid antigen test (also known as lateral flow tests) today. Additionally, they are also future-proofed for options such as rapid antibody test results when those come into play on a large scale.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>With digital identity done right, a vaccine proof (passport) would allow Canadians to securely prove who they are, verify that they were vaccinated, and have a digital credential to use in any instance that requires it — all in a safe and secure way that does not divulge any other private health record.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Festival organisers will also need to do better at managing delays than other sectors. In recent weeks, we’ve seen <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-56743571">Heathrow airport reporting delays of up to six hours</a>. This would be catastrophic at a festival – to keep festival goers waiting, after they have already waited for months to have a great time, would only lead to frustration and likely cause a bad reputation for the festival itself.</p>

      <p>In many cases, the problem underpinning IoT network security resembles the classic blockchain business case: to create trust — in this case, trustful data and message exchange — in a trustless environment. While the self-sovereign identity (SSI) concept resolves this problem in a specifically distributed manner, we want to explore current solutions, and compare their properties to distributed architectures, including SSI. Many desirable network properties (throughput, simplicity, confidentiality, to name a few) are much easier implemented in conventional solutions — it will be exciting to understand how each approach can deliver value for IoT network security depending on the specific application.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>for Privacy-Preserving System Design - The case of COVID-19 digital document verification and credential-based access control in ad hoc outdoor and indoor settings (and beyond)
In this paper we report on the design of a service system to endow next-generation COVID-19 mobile applications with the capacity: a) to instantly manage and verify a wide range of possible COVID-19 digital documents (circulation attestations, work or travel permits based on approved COVID-19 tests, vaccination certificates, etc.) and, b) to provide credential-based access control, especially in cases where the Verifier is not a web entity but a human agent with a smartphone, or an IoT device – mainly in ad hoc outdoor and indoor settings. The system has been designed as a response to the specific needs of a health emergency situation, but it may have a broader application in different cased and areas of control (such as airport and train stations checking points and board controls), where the verification process must exclude the possibility of a physical interaction between the controller and the subject of control, by maintaining a “safe distance” between them and while preserving a certain privacy for the subject of control. Our approach levers the potential of Disposable Identities, Self-Sovereign Identities technologies and Verifiable Credentials (VCs) to enable digital document verification and credential-based access control in ad hoc outdoor and indoor settings (and beyond). Towards this, we specifically introduce the concept of “Derivative” (i.e., transcoded/contextual) Verifiable Credentials. A Derivative VC is a derived bond contract guaranteeing the validity and ownership over the underlying contracts (VCs) whose: a) usability is restricted in a very specific context (that of the “local” and time-limited interaction between a Subject and a Service Provider) and, b) linking table points only to a specific “Pairwise DID”.</p>

      <p>Firstly the Working Group has expressly endorsed PKI as the technology for a new WHO trust framework for global interoperability of digitized proof of vaccination. They drew on decades of ICAO e-passport experience and consider the issue of trust framework technology to be “closed” [Ref: line 218 of the consultation paper]. Nevertheless they appreciate that implementing PKI is a significant undertaking, reporting that several countries have called for “assistance related to the establishment of their [public health authority’s] national public key infrastructure” [Ref: lines 208-214]. The role of the WHO here is a work in progress.</p>
