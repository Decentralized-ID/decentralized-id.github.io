      <p>The general problem statement here is, as you will have noticed, not about proving who you are but about proving what you are.

I do not care who you are, unless something goes wrong, it which case law enforcement or professional bodies take over.</p>

      <p>Here, then, there is most definitely a problem looking for a solution and we already know what the solution is: verifiable credentials (VCs).</p>

      <p>fintechs and regtechs looking for opportunities in the digital identity space should cast their ideas net pretty wide.

      <p>This paper addresses that need by offering arguments to a variety of people who might be reluctant to use self-sovereign identity, uninterested in its possibilities, or oblivious to the dangers of centralization. By focusing on the needs of real people, we hope to also encourage developers, engineers, and software business owners to create the apps that will address their reluctance and fulfill their needs, making self-sovereign identity a reality.</p>

      <p>This model lets the identity owner easily organize a unique, verifiable learning path from a wide variety of resources to powerfully prepare for a particular job. Similarly, employers can encourage job candidates to complete recommended learning paths for certain roles, ensuring that they enter the organization with the right skills and verifiable competencies. Or, employers can upskill employees by designing curriculums that draw upon a diverse variety of online courses, university or community college programs, coding academies, or other competency evaluation frameworks. Any course that is completed, a certificate that is earned, or work experience that is gained will produce a verifiable credential that can be shared with any other entity that uses a compatible self-sovereign identity system.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>With increasing digitization, more and more people use their identification credentials for accessing online services; which increases concern for data privacy. To ensure user’s privacy, alternate credential management schemes must be adopted. Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) is a form of credential management where users are in charge of their credentials. Privacy-critical data is stored at the user’s end and they can choose to do selective disclosure of minimal required information to access services. Currently, SSI solutions are not being widely adopted by service providers and the ecosystem is fragmented. One of the reasons for the lack of adoption is the need for maintaining private infrastructure for credential issuance, as critical user information is to be handled during credential issuance. To cater to this, we present a solution that enables the service providers to run their credential issuers on public cloud - a so-called Credentials as a Service (CaaS). CaaS issuers run inside Trusted Execution Environments (TEE) enabling credential issuers to ensure user’s privacy while enjoying the flexibility of the pay-per-use cloud model. CaaS can pave the way for making SSI credentials ubiquitous in identity management solutions.</p>

      <p>Our interest in identity systems was an inevitable outgrowth of our earlier work on blockchain-based1 land registries.2 Property registries, which at the simplest level are ledgers of who has which rights to which asset, require a very secure and reliable means of identifying both people and properties. In the course of investigating solutions to that problem, we began to appreciate the broader challenges of digital identity and its role in international development. And the more we learned about digital identity, the more convinced we became of the need for self-sovereign identity, or SSI. This model, and the underlying principles of identity which it incorporates, will be described in detail in this paper.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Building better, more human-centric solutions in smart cities starts by realising that citizens and their digital footprints are not merely aspects to monitor and evaluate. They are active participants in the cities we live and work together and need to be engaged in designing better cities and managing the data about themselves. This is not important only for respecting citizens’ rights, but it is crucial to building sustainable services and humane cities.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>this article assesses how the personas method can be adapted to include morethan-human perspectives in the design process. Based on a case study, which involved designing smart urban furniture for human and non-human use, we introduce a framework for developing and employing non-human personas. As a key element of the framework, we describe a middle-out approach for forming a coalition that can speak on behalf of the non-human species that are impacted by design decisions.</p>

      <p>DIACC firmly believes in user-centred digital ID – designed to prioritize and require user choice, control and consent regarding access to collect and manage data.
