    "Description": "Abstract. The emergence of distributed ledger technology (DLT) based upon a blockchain data structure, has given rise to new approaches to identity management that aim to upend dominant approaches to providing and consuming digital identities. These new approaches to identity management (IdM) propose to enhance decentralisation, transparency and user control in transactions that involve identity information; but, given the historical challenge to design IdM, can these new DLTbased schemes deliver on their lofty goals? We introduce the emerging landscape of DLT-based IdM, and evaluate three representative proposals \u2013 uPort, ShoCard and Sovrin \u2013 using the analytic lens of a seminal framework that characterises the nature of successful IdM schemes.",

  "A Primer on Functional Identity": {
    "Description": "There are many ways to approach identity. For the Rebooting Web of Trust, we prefer a functional approach to focus conversations on how identity works and how we use it.\n\nThe varied facets of identity are so rich that we each bring our own hot buttons and agendas to any discussion. Some people engage from a philosophical perspective, others cultural. Some dive into political issues and others get meta-physical and spiritual. These different perspectives are valid views of identity's impact on our lives. More than valid. Vital. They help answer the question of \"Why?\" Why identity matters, why we should care. Unfortunately, they also inflame passions. We sometimes talk past each other to make points that have minimal relevance for others, leaving people frustrated and unheard.\n\nAs engineers and system designers, we're concerned with how things work. We want to fix what's broken and build new things. To do that, we want to discuss how things function. With identity, this functional perspective sidesteps the inflammatory rabbit holes, without dismissing them. Functional Identity lets us investigate the HOW without prejudice to WHY, viewing identity systems based on how they work and then, in turn, how they affect individuals and society.",

  "An Accumulator Based on Bilinear Maps and Efficient Revocation for Anonymous Credentials": {
    "Description": "Abstract. The success of electronic authentication systems, be it eID card systems or Internet authentication systems such as CardSpace, highly depends on the provided level of user-privacy. Thereby, an important requirement is an efficient means for revocation of the authentication credentials. In this paper we consider the problem of revocation for certificate-based privacy-protecting authentication systems. To date, the most efficient solutions for revocation for such systems are based on cryptographic accumulators. Here, an accumulate of all currently valid certificates is published regularly and each user holds a witness enabling her to prove the validity of her (anonymous) credential while retaining anonymity. Unfortunately, the users' witnesses must be updated at least each time a credential is revoked. For the know solutions, these updates are computationally very expensive for users and/or certificate issuers which is very problematic as revocation is a frequent event as practice shows.\nIn this paper, we propose a new dynamic accumulator scheme based on bilinear maps and show how to apply it to the problem of revocation of anonymous credentials. In the resulting scheme, proving a credential's validity and updating witnesses both come at (virtually) no cost for credential owners and verifiers. In particular, updating a witness requires the issuer to do only one multiplication per addition or revocation of a credential and can also be delegated to untrusted entities from which a user could just retrieve the updated witness. We believe that thereby we provide the first authentication system offering privacy protection suitable for implementation with electronic tokens such as eID cards or drivers' licenses.",

  "An Efficient System for Non-transferable Anonymous Credentials with Optional Anonymity Revocation": {
    "Description": "Abstract. A credential system is a system in which users can obtain credentials from organizations and demonstrate possession of these credentials. Such a system is anonymous when transactions carried out by the same user cannot be linked. An anonymous credential system is of significant practical relevance because it is the best means of providing privacy for users. In this paper we propose a practical anonymous credential system that is based on the strong RSA assumption and the decisional Diffie-Hellman assumption modulo a safe prime product and is considerably superior to existing ones: (1) We give the first practical solution that allows a user to unlinkably demonstrate possession of a credential as many times as necessary without involving the issuing organization. (2) To prevent misuse of anonymity, our scheme is the first to offer optional anonymity revocation for particular transactions. (3) Our scheme offers separability: all organizations can choose their cryptographic keys independently of each other. Moreover, we suggest more effective means of preventing users from sharing their credentials, by introducing allor-nothing sharing: a user who allows a friend to use one of her credentials once, gives him the ability to use all of her credentials, i.e., taking over her identity. This is implemented by a new primitive, called circular encryption, which is of independent interest, and can be realized from any semantically secure cryptosystem in the random oracle model.",

    "Description": "an MIT paper about a NameCoin-based decentralized authentication system which maintains a public ledger of domains and their associated public keys.\n\nAuthentication is vital to all forms of remote communication. A lack of authentication opens the door to man-in-the-middle attacks, which, if performed at a key moment, may subvert the entire interaction. Current approaches to authentication on the internet include certificate authorities and webs of trust. Both of those approaches have significant drawbacks: the former relies upon trusted third parties, introducing a central point of failure, and the latter has a high barrier to entry. We propose Certcoin, an alternative, public and decentralized authentication scheme. The core idea of Certcoin is maintaining a public ledger of domains and their associated public keys. We describe the Certcoin scheme, as well as several optimizations to make Certcoin more accessible to devices with limited storage capacity, such as smartphones. Our optimizations use tools such as cryptographic accumulators and distributed hash tables.",

We present the ChainAnchor architecture that adds an identity and privacy-preserving layer above the blockchain, either the private blockchain or the public Blockchain in Bitcoin. ChainAnchor adds an anonymous identity verification step such that anyone can read and verify transactions from the blockchain but only anonymous verified identities can have transactions processed. We refer to such blockchains as semi-permissioned blockchains. ChainAnchor builds upon and makes use of the zero knowledge proof mechanisms of the EPID scheme, which has the advantage of an optional cryptographic binding to a TPM tamper-resistant hardware. The use of tamper-resistant hardware provides a significant increase in security, not only for identity-related information but also for the protection of keys used by Bitcoin wallet applications.",

Email addresses, usernames, and website domains are borrowed or \"rented\" through DNS, X.509, and social networks. This results in severe usability and security challenges Internet-wide. This paper describes a possible alternate approach called decentralized public key infrastructure (DPKI), which returns control of online identities to the entities they belong to. By doing so, DPKI addresses many usability and security challenges that plague traditional public key infrastructure (PKI). DPKI has advantages at each stage of the PKI life cycle. It makes permissionless bootstrapping of online identities possible and provides for the simple creation of stronger SSL certificates. In usage, it can help \"Johnny\" to finally encrypt thanks to its relegation of public key management to secure decentralized datastores. Finally, it includes mechanisms to recover lost or compromised identifiers.",

    "Description": "Abstract\u2014The recent increase in reported incidents of surveillance and security breaches compromising users' privacy call into question the current model, in which third-parties collect and control massive amounts of personal data. Bitcoin has demonstrated in the financial space that trusted, auditable computing is possible using a decentralized network of peers accompanied by a public ledger. In this paper, we describe a decentralized personal data management system that ensures users own and control their data. We implement a protocol that turns a blockchain into an automated access-control manager that does not require trust in a third party. Unlike Bitcoin, transactions in our system are not strictly financial \u2013 they are used to carry instructions, such as storing, querying and sharing data. Finally, we discuss possible future extensions to blockchains that could harness them into a well-rounded solution for trusted computing problems in society",

    "Description": "Abstract\u2014Digital identity is unsolved: after many years of research there is still no trusted communication over the Internet. To provide identity within the context of mutual distrust, this paper presents a blockchain-based digital identity solution. Without depending upon a single trusted third party, the proposed solution achieves passport-level legally valid identity. This solution for making identities Self-Sovereign, builds on a generic provable claim model for which attestations of truth from third parties need to be collected. The claim model is then shown to be both blockchain structure and proof method agnostic. Four different implementations in support of these two claim model properties are shown to offer sub-second performance for claim creation and claim verification. Through the properties of Self-Sovereign Identity, legally valid status and acceptable performance, our solution is considered to be fit for adoption by the general public.",

They consider the history of interactions between peers to establish a measure for a reputation that can itself be used to support a trust decision. Decentralised reputations systems (DRS) rely on a decentralised computer architecture and a distributed ledger to store and maintain reputation information, so that no single entity has control over that information.\n\nWhile there have been numerous analyses of how reputation may be used, there has to date been no systematic definition of the various aspects that should be considered when a reputation system is being designed. By defining these design considerations, we can come to a consensus about what is and is not important in a system. We can discuss the different ways in which they can be built and we can conduct further research and analysis into specific factors in a structured way.",

As public identities have been created by different authorities, and since a global public or private identity is not a realistic option in the short term, interoperability and the collaboration between different entities to offer complete solutions is decisive.

For us, births and deaths are routinely and accurately documented. Yet more than 100 developing countries lack functional civil registration and vital statistics (CRVS) systems, and 230 million children under the age of five haven't been registered. Some countries like Malawi and Ethiopia have registration rates in the single digits. Experts estimate that there are 1.5 billion people without a legal identity.

    "Description": "An identity is a collection of attributes about an entity that distinguish it from other entities. Entities are anything with distinct existence, such as people, organizations, concepts, or devices. Some entities, such as people, are multifaceted, having multiple identities that they present to the world. People are often able to establish trust by demonstrating that others have made valuable claims about their identities. One way of doing this is by presenting a credential. A credential is a set of claims made by an entity about an identity. A credential may refer to a qualification, achievement, quality, or other information about an identity such as a name, government ID, home address, or university degree that typically indicates suitability.",

That same flexibility and expressivity also makes it easy to misunderstand subtle nuances and often leads to ideological debate rather than understanding and applications. We compensate with adjectives, creating new phrases like \u201cdigital identity\u201d or \u201clegal identity\u201d, but we often still speak past each other. We regularly refer to \u201cidentities\u201d as things that are assigned to us or that we own, things we control or present, instead of using more rigorous terms such as \u201cidentifiers\u201d or \u201ccredentials\u201d. This fluidity often confuses because, at its core, identity is an emergent phenomenon that doesn't have an existence independent of the observer.",

The current approach has both security and scalability issues. Transitioning the Hubs design to an ocap model can be achieved by introducing an UMA authorization server as the control endpoint. This avoids creating confused-deputy security issues and expands scale by enabling the hub to delegate access to resources not stored in the hub itself.",

  "Introduction to DID Auth": {

We define DID Auth as a ceremony where an identity owner, with the help of various components such as web browsers, mobile devices, and other agents, proves to a relying party that they are in control of a DID. This means demonstrating control of the DID using the mechanism specified in the DID Document's \"authentication\" object. This could take place using a number of different data formats, protocols, and flows. DID Auth includes the ability to establish mutually authenticated communication channels and to authenticate to web sites and applications. Authorization, Verifiable Credentials, and Capabilities are built on top of DID Auth and are out of scope for this document. This paper gives on overview of the scope of DID Auth, supported protocols and flows, and the use of components of the DID Documents that are relevant to authentication, as well as formats for challenges and responses.",

Although the technical details of DID Auth are not well-defined at this point, its general concept is clear: With self-sovereign identity infrastructure, the most trivial and straightforward functionality for identity owners should be the ability to authenticate, i.e. to prove control of a DID in some relationship or during a transaction. This could take place using a number of different data formats, protocols, and flows. DID Auth includes the ability to authenticate to web sites and applications, and to establish mutually authenticated communication channels. In this webinar, we will discuss the current state of the DID Auth concept, and how it relates to other efforts such as Verifiable Credentials and agent protocols.

In this paper, we explore layering an object capability model on top of Linked Data Signatures via chains of signed proclamations. fn:1 We call this system \"Linked Data Capabilities\", or \"ld-ocap\" for short.\n\nThe system we propose can work regardless of whether https identifiers or DIDs are being used. Since DIDs work nicely with this system and add an additional layer of decentralization we use them for the URIs of this system.",

The new network was named Kovan and is a primary test network available to all Ethereum users today.\n\nPoA consensus is essentially an optimized Proof of Stake model that leverages identity as the form of stake rather than actually staking tokens. The identity is staked by a group of validators (authorities) that are pre-approved to validate transactions and blocks within the respective network. The group of validators is usually supposed to remain fairly small (~25 or less) in order to ensure efficiency and manageable security of the network.",

  "RBFT: Redundant Byzantine Fault Tolerance": {
    "Description": "Abstract\u2014Byzantine Fault Tolerant state machine replication (BFT) protocols are replication protocols that tolerate arbitrary faults of a fraction of the replicas. Although significant efforts have been recently made, existing BFT protocols do not provide acceptable performance when faults occur. As we show in this paper, this comes from the fact that all existing BFT protocols targeting high throughput use a special replica, called the primary, which indicates to other replicas the order in which requests should be processed. This primary can be smartly malicious and degrade the performance of the system without being detected by correct replicas. In this paper, we propose a new approach, called RBFT for Redundant-BFT: we execute multiple instances of the same BFT protocol, each with a primary replica executing on a different machine. All the instances order the requests, but only the requests ordered by one of the instances, called the master instance, are actually executed. The performance of the  different instances is closely monitored, in order to check that the master instance provides adequate performance. If that is not the case, the primary replica of the master instance is considered malicious and replaced. We implemented RBFT and compared its performance to that of other existing robust protocols. Our evaluation shows that RBFT achieves similar performance as the most robust protocols when there is no failure and that, under faults, its maximum performance degradation is about 3%, whereas it is at least equal to 78% for existing protocols.",

    "Description": "Situation: Information management enables humanitarian organizations to make adequate interventions based on timely, appropriate and trustworthy information. A crucial type of information are identities, because they can be used to assess vulnerability and efficiently manage aid distribution. Vulnerability determines who receives aid first because resources are always limited. This information is increasingly being stored and processed in identity systems. Complication: Most identity systems are centralized and produce analogue proofs of identity such as passports or ID cards. These systems are susceptible to privacy and data breaches. Centralization leads to single-points-of-failure and could lead to fraudulent behavior resulting in people lacking formal proofs of identity. In general there is limited interoperability between identity systems and limited collaboration between the owners of these systems. Approach: To create an interoperable and shared digital identity system using a Design Science Research strategy and systems engineering approach. This system must be distributed, protect privacy and put the identity owner in control of his or her data. The foundation of the system consists of Humanitarian Information Management principles, Privacy-by-Design principles and Self-Sovereign Identity principles. This research creates a functional blockchain based system, that enables identities for the use-case of Cash Transfer Programs. Results: We present a validated set of ten design decisions that represent the trade-offs that have been made and prescribe a blueprint for a technical design. Next steps: Future research should be done on how such a system could be implemented and used. This would require a process design approach that has to be developed, Also, elaborate research into user experience and user interfaces should be conducted.",

The interconnectedness of people, services and devices is a defining aspect of the digital revolution, and, secure digital identities are an important prerequisite for secure and legally compliant information exchange. Existing approaches to realize a secure identity management focus on central providers of identitiessuch as national authorities or online service providers. Hence, changing residence or service provider often  means to start over and creating new identities, because procedures for data portability are missing. Self-sovereign digital identities are instead created and managed by individuals, and enable them to maintain their digital identities independent from residence, national eID infrastructure and market-dominating service providers.

Rights over this IP have generally been unclear, resulting in systematic abuse or unfair use of people's personal data by third parties. But new regulations are changing this - most notably, the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (EU GDPR). Third parties must now obtain explicit and documented consent from people (data subjects) to collect, process, store or disclose their personal data. A specification for operationalising these regulatory requirements, using digital Consent Receipts, is being developed through the Consent and Information-Sharing Working Group of the Kantara Initiative. In a parallel effort, COALA-IP has developed a blockchain-ready, community-driven generic protocol for intellectual property licensing that applies the Linked Content Coalition (LCC) framework to 'unify digital rights data management'. This paper proposes a decentralised Smart Consent protocol for managing personal data as intellectual property that combines elements of the COALA-IP Specification for Digital Intellectual Property with the specification for Digital Consent Receipts.",

Given the evident limitations of this design, we propose an alternative with more powerful capabities, based on the ability to explicitly outline and fully program conditions for verification. These conditions would then be used to determine when a signature or set of signatures can be considered valid.\n\nOur inspiration for this authorization system is the bitcoin scripting language, where the authorization to spend funds is explicitly defined within a script, rather than being implicitly defined through the reference to an authorized public key. The largest benefit of explicit specification of authorization conditions is that the system is fully extensible, so new operations can be defined at any time, with the only limitation being the set of operations that the authorization interpreters understand.

Our PoC demonstrates a simple use case for verifiable credentials. The demo shows how a self-sovereign identity (SSI) can obtain credentials from an issuer and supply these credentials to a verifier in response to a proof request, thus providing a verifiable proof. Though just a small example of how verifiable credentials are exchanged in a Hyperledger Indy environment, it's a great way to learn and start planning your own solution using verifiable credentials.",

  "TOWARDS SELF-SOVEREIGN IDENTITY USING BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY": {
    "Description": "With more than three billion internet users, each with multiple digital identities, the management of these identities is very important.  Surveys show that people often use the identity management systems  they don't want to use. They don't have full control over their information, have no way to know what is shared with other parties and are dependent on trusted parties when logging in to websites. Blockchain technology is used as basis for a secure and transparent distributed ledger for the Bitcoin cryptocurrency. Its decentralized, public and immutable properties solve the double spending problem and allow every participant of the network to read the transaction history, help in the validation process and pay and receive Bitcoin.\nCryptographically complex math ensures that everyone can do transactions with everyone without the need for a trusted third party. Nextto financial transactions, this also holds for other claims. Entities can put claims on a decentralized ledger by digitally signing it, which allows any other entity to verify that these claims are made by that specific entity.\nThis allows authorities like governments to make claims about individuals, which can be combined with other claims to create a very strong claim about someone. Because both the claimant and the claimee can be verified, this allows entities like mortgage lenders to outsource their Customer Due Diligence (CDD) processes.\nIn this research we will explore the possibility of self-sovereign identity, where you are in control of your digital identity. We started with a desk research on currently available identity man agement solutions. We concluded that in most systems, the end-user is not able to store their own data. Currently only one decentralized system is available, but has not gained wide adoption yet.\nA case study has been performed on a solution which allows the ex change of KYC attributes, resulting from thorough Customer Due Dili gence (CDD) as is often performed when opening a bank account. These attributes can be used by other entities, like insurance companies and mortgage lenders to make their on-boarding process easier for customers, since they don't need to supply copies of the same documentation all over again. Also, the companies themselves could outsource their Customer Due Diligence (CDD) this way to lower costs and make fewer errors. Although the idea is very interesting, the studied solution did not meet the expectations. At the time the company behind the solution was very small and the process to improve very complex. The solution was also proprietary, creating dependence on the vendor, which heightens the adoption barrier.\nBecause of the lessons learned from the case study, the results of the literature research and the desk research, we designed an architecture for a Decentralized Identity Management System (DIMS) using the concept of claim-based identity and blockchain technology. To lower adoption barriers and create a self-sustaining ecosystem, it will be developed on a public blockchain and source code will be made open-source. The solution will be privacy-friendly by using privacy-enhancing techniques and storing only claims about one's identity. We also provide a solution to allow retrieval of more sensitive data, and made it as modular as possible to make integration within existing IT architecture easier.\nThe Decentralized Identity Management System (DIMS) can be useful in a wide range of use cases, like proving your age when buying liquor at the supermarket or applying for a health insurance where you get a student discount if you can show your are enrolled at a university. This shows that our work resulted in a solid foundation for self-sovereign identity using blockchain technology.\u2014by D.S. Baars.",

    "Description": "The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) enacted by the European Parliament in 2016 was designed to give users more control and rights over their personal data. Companies and governments will find it increasingly difficult to be GDPR compliant with current industry practices. Once it becomes enforceable in 2018, managing data will be both toxic and expensive. Many precious resources will be required for improving and maintaining the security, privacy, and governance of personal data. Methods for storing less personal data will ease the burden of GDPR compliance. This document explores describes what GDPR requirements are, what are the different approaches to digital identity solutions and finally explains why a distributed ledger technology may offer an opportunity to enterprises for simpler data management solutions that are GDPR compliant.",
