Standards,arxiv,,,,,,,,,A Taxonomic Approach to Understanding Emerging Blockchain Identity Management Systems (NIST CYBERSECURITY WHITE PAPER),"Identity management systems (IDMSs) are widely used to provision user identities while managing authentication, authorization, and data sharing both within organizations as well as on the Internet more broadly. Traditional identity systems typically suffer from single points of failure, lack of interoperability, and privacy issues such as encouraging mass data collection and user tracking. Blockchain technology has the potential to support novel data ownership and governance models with built-in control and consent mechanisms, which may benefit both users and businesses by alleviating these concerns; as a result, blockchain-based IDMSs are beginning to proliferate. This work categorizes these systems into a taxonomy based on differences in architecture, governance models, and other salient features. We provide context for the taxonomy by describing related terms, emerging standards, and use cases, while highlighting relevant security and privacy considerations.

Standards,WebOfTrustInfo,,,,,,,,RWoT,Recommendations for Decentralized Key Management Systems,"A decentralized key management system (DKMS) aims to solve how consumers can manage their own keys and certificates without relying on a third-party provider having access or controls over the keys.. This method helps to ensure that no third-party can compromise the integrity and security of the system as a whole. Entities can use the system to safely authenticate each other and validate keys and certificates. Centralized key management systems (CKMS) manage key and certificate creation, signing, and validity. Specific problems arise when these authorities become unavailable, or the data they control becomes corrupted or known. Central authorities often become choice targets for attackers. This document proposes to meet these requirements with a decentralized blockchain ledger for providing an oracle of trust and leave control over all keys with end users. The use of a blockchain permits globally readable identifiers and public data to be shared in a secure manner that is not vulnerable to the man-in-the-middle attack or system wide compromise and permits consumers to be self-sovereign. This leaves consumers with the task of key management and protection. This document covers various ideas for how users may create, recover, backup, and revoke keys and provides recommended suggestions.",,https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rebooting-the-web-of-trust-fall2017/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/dkms-recommendations.md,,Paper,,,Decentralized Identity Stack,,,,,,,,2017-09-15,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DIDs are useful for any application that benefits from self-administered, cryptographically verifiable identifiers such as personal identifiers, organizational identifiers, and identifiers for Internet of Things scenarios. For example, current commercial deployments of W3C Verifiable Credentials heavily utilize Decentralized Identifiers to identify people, organizations, and things and to achieve a number of security and privacy-protecting guarantees.

A DID identifies any subject (e.g., a person, organization, thing, data model, abstract entity, etc.) that the controller of the DID decides that it identifies. In contrast to typical, federated identifiers, DIDs have been designed so that they may be decoupled from centralized registries, identity providers, and certificate authorities. Specifically, while other parties might be used to help enable the discovery of information related to a DID, the design enables the controller of a DID to prove control over it without requiring permission from any other party.

For some, the notion of a DID anchored to DNS is anathema, for others, DIDs that cannot be publicly verified are problematic. This debate about decentralization is a continuation of a similar, ongoing argument in cryptocurrency circles: the question of whether or not bitcoin or ethereum is more decentralized is a nearly endless source of argument. Rather than attempting to resolve this potentially unresolvable question, we propose a rubric — which is a scoring guide used to evaluate performance, a product, or a project — that teaches how to evaluate a given DID method according to one’s own requirements. Our goal is to develop a guide that minimizes judgment and bias. Rather than advocating particular solutions, the rubric presents a series of criteria which an evaluator can apply to any DID method based on their particular use cases. We also avoid reducing the evaluation to a single number because the criteria tend to be multidimensional and many of the options are not necessarily good or bad: it is the obligation of the evaluator to understand how each response in each criteria might illuminate favorable or unfavorable consequences for their needs. Finally, this rubric allows evaluating aspects of decentralization of a DID method, but it is not exhaustive, and does not cover other issues that may affect selection or adoption of a particular method, such as privacy or efficiency.","RWOT9 in Prague, The Czech Republic (September 2019) - rwot9-prague/decentralized-did-rubric.md at master · WebOfTrustInfo/rwot9-prague",https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot9-prague/blob/master/draft-documents/decentralized-did-rubric.md,,Paper,,,Main,,,,,,,,2019-09-06,,,,,,,,,,,,,

W3C,W3C,,,,,,,,,Identity Interoperability,"TimBL's diagram at TPAC2012Over the years many different authentication systems have been developed. Each one proposes a method for an agent to prove his relation to an identifier - called a Principal. A Principal is a string that can be mapped to a URI, that usually refers to some network resource, which itself can then be linked to a subject. An LDP authorization system may authenticate agents that are allowed access to a resource using different types of Principals. This page lists a number of ways Authorization agents can prove identity of an agent using one Principal, with an ACL that may be using a different type of Principal. The aim is to gather such examples together in order to find an general theory that underpins these proofs.",,https://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/webid/wiki/Identity_Interoperability,https://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/webid/wiki/images/thumb/2/2f/IdentityInterop.jpg/250px-IdentityInterop.jpg,Post,,,W3C ID History,,,,,,,,2013-01-07,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this paper, we describe a project underway at Identity Commons to create a framework within which users can express their protection preferences (called identity rights agreements).

W3C,W3C,,,,,,,,,W3C Workshop on Identity in the Browser,"Over the last ten years, for most end-users there has been no visible progress beyond cookie-managed usernames and passwords entered via HTML forms. Current password-based logins offers little value to the end-user, as they are forced to bear the onerous responsibility of remembering too many passwords or simply re-using low-security passwords. <br><br>As passwords and cookies are easily compromised, both web-site operators and users then expose themselves to massive security breaches. Despite the large amount of valuable standardization work on identity, it is unclear how user agents such as Web browsers can interact with both identity-consuming applications and server-side federated identity services, and many current identity specifications either assume or underspecify secure authentication in the browser. The key missing component to enable trusted identity on the Web is likely then to be found in user-centric cross-browser standards for secure authentication and session management.",,https://www.w3.org/2011/identity-ws/report.html,,Report,,,W3C ID History,,,,,,,,2011,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, users have to give away a lot of information about themselves to many different services. The point is that the users lose control of their identity on the web, by filling a lot of forms (e.g., through subscriptions). Privacy on the Internet is extremely important and must remain. Personal information is used by services we, sometimes, don't even know about, and it is a real problem. The aim of this group would be to think about new ways to identify individuals over the internet using trusted web based identities embedded directly into the core protocols of the web. At the same time it is important to maintain equilibrium between total privacy and providing information when needed, which means, when the user wants to.",,https://www.w3.org/community/w3id/,,org,,,W3C ID History,,,,,,,,2014-10-26,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most of you don’t know what WebAuthn is yet, but many of you will feel the impact in short order.  In fact, I will go so far as to say that WebAuthn may change how we all authenticate to the resources we use every day. <br><br>We live in a world where the best parts of our individual local hardware and software collection are rarely leveraged to make cloud security decisions.  This is because there has never been a vendor-agnostic and privacy-preserving way for cloud resources to interact with individual hardware configurations in any generic way.  Until now! <br><br>With WebAuthn, any web entity can call a simple Javascript API and ask for a cryptographically secure credential.   What happens next is pretty cool – the world’s browsers have worked with the world’s operating system makers and the world’s hardware manufacturers, so that when a website asks for a credential, the browsers work with the underlying platform to securely locate compliant local hardware and talk to it!",,https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/identity-standards-blog/why-webauthn-will-change-the-world/ba-p/482286,,Post,,,Main,,,,,,,,2019-04-19,,,,,,,,,,,,,

More in detail, authenticationof the issuing institution is performed by retrieving anunauthenticated issuer profile online, and comparing somedata reported there with those included in the issuedcertificate. We show that, by fabricating a fake issuerprofile and generating a suitably altered certificate, anattacker is able to impersonate a legitimate issuer andcan produce certificates that cannot be distinguished fromoriginals by the Blockcerts validation procedure.

Would it be possible to create an extensible and multipurpose cryptographic link that provides discoverability, integrity, and scheme agility?<br>Cryptographic linking solutions today have yet to provide a generalized mechanism for creating tamper-evident links. The Subresource Integrity standard limits this guarantee to script and link resources loaded on Web pages via the use of HTML attributes. IPFS provides a verification mechanism that is constrained to hash-based, content-addressable links, with no ability to complete content negotiation. RFC6920 proposes another mechanism that cannot be applied to existing links: it recommends the use of named information hashes and a resolution method that creates a content addressable URL [1].

"Linked Data, Object Capabilities",CCG,,,,,,,,,Authorization Capabilities for Linked Data v0.3,"Authorization Capabilities for Linked Data (ZCAP-LD for short) provides a secure way for linked data systems to grant and express authority utilizing the object capability model. Capabilities are represented as linked data objects which are signed with Linked Data Proofs. ZCAP-LD supports delegating authority to other entities on the network by chaining together capability documents. ""Caveats"" may be attached to capability documents which may be used to restrict the scope of their use, for example to restrict the actions which may be used or providing a mechanism by which the capability may be later revoked.<br><br>[...] Relationship to Verifiable Credentials [...]<br><br>We seem to be in a conundrum. Claims and credentials are forms of correlation that allow us to reason about an entity in our squishy human world, but are unsafe when used as mechanisms to authorize some event to occur within a system. Capabilities are a safe mechanism to model the flow of authority through a system, but there are times when capabilities have not been granted and we need to make a ""judgement call"" by correlating information about that entity. What should we do?<br><br>To pose the question is to see the answer: the right approach is to use each system for what it does best. Use correlation (Verifiable Credentials) in a reasoning system (most commonly human reasoning) as a path to make judgements about whether to hand an entity a specific set of initial capabilities. Use capabilities (ZCAP-LD) as the mechanism to grant and exercise authority through computing systems. To return to our system administrator example, when Alice applies for the job, she submits a series of credentials about her prior work history and degree, and Eva is able to verify that it is Alice's former employers and university which have made these claims. Deciding that Alice is fit for the job, Eva hands Alice her initial capability which grants her authority to administrate the systems in question (with a caveat that allows Eva to revoke that authority at a future date, if appropriate). Alice uses that capability as the initial entry point into administrating the system.

KERI,,,https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.02143,Samuel Smith,,,,,,KEY EVENT RECEIPT INFRASTRUCTURE (KERI) DESIGN,"An identity system based secure overlay for the Internet is presented. This includes a primary root-of-trust in self-certifying identifiers. It presents a formalism for Autonomic Identifiers (AIDs) and Autonomic Namespaces (ANs). They are part of an Autonomic Identity System (AIS). This system uses the design principle of minimally sufficient means to provide a candidate trust spanning layer for the internet. Associated with this system is a decentralized key management infrastructure (DKMI). The primary root-of-trust are self-certifying identifiers that are strongly bound at issuance to a cryptographic signing (public, private) key-pair. These are self-contained until/unless control needs to be transferred to a new key-pair. In that event an append only chained key-event log of signed transfer statements provides end verifiable control provenance. This makes intervening operational infrastructure replaceable because the event logs may be therefore be served up by ambient infrastructure. End verifiable logs on ambient infrastructure enables ambient verifiability (verifiable by anyone, anywhere, at anytime). The primary key management operation is key rotation (transference) via a novel key pre-rotation scheme. Two primary trust modalities motivated the design, these are a direct (one-to-one) mode and an indirect (one-to-any) mode. In the direct mode, the identity controller establishes control via verified signatures of the controlling key-pair. The indirect mode extends that trust basis with witnessed key event receipt logs (KERLs) for validating events. The security and accountability guarantees of indirect mode are provided by KERIs Agreement Algorithm for Control Establishment (KACE) among a set of witnesses.",,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SmithSamuelM/Papers/master/whitepapers/KERI_WP_2.x.web.pdf,,,2.54,,Main,,,,,,,,2020-10-22,,,,,,,,,,,,,

KERI,,,,Samuel Smith,,,,,,UNIVERSAL IDENTIFIER THEORY,Abstract—A universal theory for identifiers is presented. This theory is based on a unified model of identifiers that include cryptographic autonomic identifiers (AIDs) and legitimized (authorized) human meaningful identifiers (LIDs). This model provides truly decentralized trust bases each derived from the cryptographic root-of-trust of a given AID. An AID is based on a self-certifying identifier (SCID) prefix. Self certifying identifiers are not human meaningful but have strong cryptographic properties. The associated self-certifying trust basis gives rise to a trust do- main for associated cryptographically verifiable non-repudiable statements. Every other type of identifier including human meaningful identifiers may then be secured in this resultant trust do- main via an end-verifiable authorization. This authorization legitimizes that human meaningful identifier as an LID though its association with an AID. The result is a secured trust domain specific identifier couplet of aid\|lid. AIDs are provided by the open standard key event receipt infrastructure (KERI). This unified model provides a systematic methodology for the design and implementation of secure decentralized identifier systems that underpin decentralized trust bases and their associated ecosystems of interactions.,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SmithSamuelM/Papers/master/whitepapers/IdentifierTheory_web.pdf,,,,,Main,,,,,,,,2020-10-23,,,,,,,,,,,,,

And in most we don’t say our names. “Michael” being a common name, a guy called “Mike” may tell a barista his name is “Clive” if the guy in front of him just said his name is “Mike.” (My given name is David, a name so common that another David re-branded me Doc. Later I learned that his middle name was David and his first name was Paul. True story.)",,https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2020/10/22/keri/,,Post,,,About,,,,,,,,2020-10-22,,,,,,,,,,,,,
KERI,Jolocom,,,,Jolocom,,,,,How KERI tackles the problem of trust,"In contrast to blockchain or central registry-based trust systems, KERI is based on a hash-chain data structure called a ‘key event receipt log’ (KERL). Conceptually, it’s similar in some ways to the Peer DID Method specification, except that its data model is a KERL rather than a DID document. And while KERI can be used as a DID method, it is fundamentally not reliant on any of the DID specifications and can be used in many other contexts as well. In particular, it is also useful for Internet of Things (IoT) networks and other security-conscious, low-resource use cases.",,https://jolocom.io/blog/how-keri-tackles-the-problem-of-trust/,,Post,,,About,,,,,,,,2020-10-15,,,,,,,,,,,,,

KERI,Human Colossus Foundation,,,,,,,,,Thinking of DID? KERI On,"The current generation of DIDs has introduced an innovative approach to digital identifiers, which has triggered the SSI movement. However, the inclusion of the method space in the DID syntax has led to fragmentation and weak security properties of the identifier type. These known method-space issues give the community impetus to redress them. In light of these innovative developments, now is the time to embrace KERI as an improved interoperable and secure solution for digital identity.","In this blog post, we address DIDs security from the viewpoint of KERI (Key Event Receipt Infrastructure), a novel, simple, and improved DKMS (Decentralized Key Management System) solution for digital identifiers. KERI provides a unifying solution to DID document authentication and resolution that will prove invaluable to use cases where security and interoperability are essential (e.g., for global supply chains and humanitarian applications).",https://humancolossus.foundation/blog/thinking-of-did-keri-on,,Post,,,About,,,,,,,,2021-01-27,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The hypothesis is that the W3C Verifiable Credential standard may be expanded to serve as an Authentic Data Container (ADC) with authentic provenance chains (APC) as a super semantic.

However, global consistency may only matter after members of that community need to interact, not before.<br><br>### Q: How secure is the KERI infrastructure?<br><br>KERI changes the discussion about security. From a discussion about the security of infrastructure to a discussion about the security of your key management infrastructure. Most people when they think security, the think “oh, blockchain!”: permissioned or permissionless, how hard is it to get 51% attack, etc.Non of that matters for KERI. KERI is all about “are your private keys private?!” And if yes, that drastically slims down the security discussion to brute force attacks to public keys. And because the next public keys are in fact protected by a hash, you have to brute force the hash algorithm, that is post-quantum secure. So that is a very high level of infrastructural security.<br><br>So private key management and protection is the root of your security in KERI.<br><br>### *Q: You are arguing KERI affords greater security than a decentralized linear event system like Bitcoin?<br><br>…you would be fundamentally arguing that you can record a singular, immutable linear event history more securely than Bitcoin, and I see nothing in KERI that would indicate that.<br><br>Read the answer to [this](https://identity.foundation/keri/docs/Q-and-A-Security.html#keri-is-basically-a-series-of-pay2publickeyhash-transactions) first.<br><br>If you read Szabo’s paper on threshold structures, you get security of the same type when ever you use a threshold structure, be it MFA, Multi-Sig, or Distributed consensus. They all are using a combination of multiple relatively weak attack surfaces that must be simulatenously compromised for a successful attack. So multiplying simulatneous weak surfaces = functional equivalent of a stronger attack surface. So when you look at KERI you see that the security is primarily due to cryptographic strength and the witnesses are not the primary source of security but merely secure one thing, that is the availability of the KEL for an identifier. Not the KEL itself. The KEL iteself is secured by signatures.<br><br>From a Validator perspective their security is due to duplicity detection. Successful attack against duplicity detection requires an eclipse attack. Ledgers such as bitcoin are also susceptible to eclipse attacks. So in an apples to apples (resistance to eclipse attack) a KERI watcher network of comparable reach (1000’s of watchers) would have comparable resistance to an eclipse attack.<br><br>### Q: Differences between blockchain-based security and KERI security<br><br>* Where KERI doesn’t need total ordering in its logs, blockchain do need that. What KERI needs is watchers that construct string of event in the relative order of reception of the KEL {TBW please explain or improve this: what is this, why is it important?}<br><br>* Another characteristic is that KERI identifiers are transferable and blockchain-based identifiers are not, they are bound to their ledger.",Key Event Receipt Infrastructure - the spec and implementation of the KERI protocol,https://identity.foundation/keri/docs/Q-and-A-Security.html#qa-section-keri-security-considerations,https://identity.foundation/keri/images/Direct-mode-kel-kerl.png,page,,,Development,,,,,,,,2021-04-06,,,,,,,,,,,,,

KERI,DIF,,https://hackmd.io/orhyiJkLT721v4PCPkvQiA?both,,,,,,,Implementation Notes for KERI,"The interpretation of the data associated with the digest or hash tree root in the seal is independent of KERI. This allows KERI to be agnostic about anchored data semantics. Another way of saying this is that seals are data agnostic; they don’t care about the semantics of its associated data. This better preserves privacy because the seal itself does not leak any information about the purpose or specific content of the associated data. Furthermore, because digests are a type of content address, they are self-discoverable. This means there is no need to provide any sort of context or content specific tag or label for the digests. Applications that use KERI may provide discovery of a digest via a hash table (mapping) whose indexes (hash keys) are the digests and the values in the table are the location of the digest in a specific event. To restate, the semantics of the digested data are not needed for discovery of the digest within a key event sequence.",,https://github.com/decentralized-identity/keri/blob/master/implementation.md,,,,,Development,,,,,,,,2020-05-16,,,,,,,,,,,,,
