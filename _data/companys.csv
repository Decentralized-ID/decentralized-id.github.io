Animo,,Animo,,Timo Glastra; Ana Goessens,Digibyte; ESSIFlab,"European Union, Netherlands, Utrecht",Europe,,,Animo,"A Change In How We Handle Verification<br><br>The world is set up in a way where everyone continually needs to prove aspects of themselves. Organisations need personal information about their customers to verify their identity to give them access to services. Institutions like colleges, governments and banks need to verify information to assist people in their day to day life. To do this in the digital world people currently fill out countless forms, create accounts for every service and send copies of sensitive documents over email. This has resulted in people's information being scattered around the web, given to and stored by countless organisations, with no easy way to control and manage it.<br><br>Animo is working to change this. Through a relatively new technology called verifiable credentials, it is possible for users to store personal information about themselves in a digital wallet on their phone. Organisations that need to verify some information about the user (e.g. age, address, membership, qualification, etc.) can send a request and, with user permission, get the information they need without having to store any personal data themselves. The user proves aspects of their digital identity while keeping control over any personal information.","Our aim We build digital infrastructure that makes the world function as it should. Without borders, without vendor lock-in, without limitations. We work for a future where every individual is in control of their life. What we do At Animo we work with developers and organizations to improve digital interaction using verifiable credentials. We create solutions where exchanging data is privacy preserving and frictionless. SEE HOW IT WORKS Who we are Our team works hard to solve the most difficult problems without taking shortcuts. At Animo we understand the value in using open source and open standards to get the job done, working together makes innovation easy.

We believe that people should be able to determine how, what, and with whom they share their personal details. We build the tools necessary to empower our brand partners’ users and end consumers with the necessary capabilities to protect and control their digital information. Anonyome Labs puts control back into users’ hands through mobile and desktop applications.","Privacy is progress Privacy will be the defining topic of this decade. We believe personal freedom hinges on safety and security, and this liberty is essential in our expanding digital world. We provide scalable mobile and desktop solutions that empower users to protect their private information. The challenge In today’s world millions of consumers manage much of their lives online, requiring personally identifiable information at every turn. Consumers need access to these online conveniences while also protecting their personal information. Businesses need better ways of interacting with their customers without the risks associated with collecting their personal data. The solution To meet the challenges facing businesses and consumers, Anonyome Labs provides a platform that enables a next generation approach to security and privacy. A cornerstone of this platform includes limited disclosure digital identities, that we call “Sudos”.

The platform is complete with all the components necessary to build secure and private market offerings. These scalable components include secure and private calling, messaging, video, browsing, purchasing, and more. The Sudo Platform enables businesses to empower their users through privacy and cyber safety capabilities. We provide a variety of tools that can be rapidly integrated into B2C product and service offerings. To show how the platform can be used, we provide a reference consumer application called MySudo. Sudo Platform The Complete Privacy Toolkit Sudo Platform is a set of easy-to-use privacy solutions that can be integrated into your existing and new products. Sudo Platform APIs and SDKs are quick to learn and simple to use.
