A data NFT represents the copyright (or exclusive license against copyright) for a data asset on the blockchain — we call this the “base IP”. When a user publishes a dataset in OceanOnda V4, they create a new NFT as part of the process. This data NFT is proof of your claim of base IP. Assuming a valid claim, you are entitled to the revenue from that asset, just like a title deed gives you the right to receive rent.

Summary: The hype over NFTs and collectibles is blinding us to their true usefulness as trustworthy persistent data objects. How do they sit in the landscape with verifiable credentials and picos? Listening to this Reality 2.0 podcast about NFTs with Doc Searls, Katherine Druckman, and their guest Greg Bledsoe got me thinking about NFTs.

  > This session described how we can use the authentic data solution to track provenance and controllership of digital data and effectively create NFTs, now called NFADs, that are completely independent of blockchains and tokens. This eliminates minting and transfer costs common on the NFT silos. I have provided link to the slides.
* [Introduction to NFTs for Identity](https://walt.id/decentralized-identity-explained/nfts) walt.id

NFT use cases can be found wherever there’s a need to digitally model ownership. In other words, the list of use cases is long and NFTs will likely be among the most important building blocks on which the digital world (or something like a metaverse) will be built.-

“I was working on an online trading-card game in the early days that had player-to-player card trades enabled through our servers. The vast majority of our customer support emails dealt with requests to reverse a trade because of some kind of trade scams. When I saw [Hearthstone’s dust system](https://playhearthstone.com/en-us/news/10245930), I realized it was genius; they probably cut their support costs by around 90% with that move alone.”

  > There’s a thread in a list I’m on titled “NFTs are a Scam.” I know too little about NFTs to do more than dump here three thoughts I shared on the list in response to a post that suggested that owning digital seemed to be a mania of some kind. Here goes…
* [What Do NFTs Do Well?](https://indicio.tech/what-do-nfts-do-well/) Indicio

NFTs are technologically interesting as a way of proving ownership and facilitating value transfer; but they are problematic if applied to proving a person’s identity.

* [SoulBound](https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/01/26/soulbound.html) NFTs…by Vitalik

A soulbound item, once picked up, cannot be transferred or sold to another player.

Most very powerful items in the game are soulbound, and typically require completing a complicated quest or killing a very powerful monster, usually with the help of anywhere from four to thirty nine other players.

Imagine a 3D immersive environment along the lines of Second Life. You “decorate” your “home” with “art”. You pop up an obligatory Persistence of Memory Dali print. But is it “real” and what does real even mean? In the physical realm, we know that this is only one original, which is at the MOMA in NYC. But what about the various quality prints that I can buy – at the MOMA, on Amazon, on the street.

  > we describe how self-sovereign identity (SSI) can be the solution to verify the origin and legitimacy of an NFT and its linked object, and we invite you to join Gimly and bitcoin artist Petek [@RaydarRayne](https://twitter.com/RadarRayne) on our journey to fulfill the potential of NFTs for digital and physical artists alike.

* [SSI for NFTs with Caspar Roelofs from Gimly](https://northernblock.io/ssi-for-nfts/) SSI Orbit Podcast

That’s definitely one of the ideas that I’m exploring for more longer-term. [...] to have an embedded a private key in a secure element within the IOT device, and be able to verify the identity or the source of your IOT data through an [SSI mechanism](https://northernblock.io/self-sovereign-identity-for-organizations/). That’s the longer-term, broader vision when talking about the supply chain, for sure.

* [Ontology Providing DID Solutions to NFT + Music Streaming Platform, ROCKI](https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-providing-did-solutions-to-music-streaming-platform-rocki-5ae6c1704483)

NFTs offer creators a novel way to monetize their creations. Unfortunately, there have been [reports](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/20/22334527/nft-scams-artists-opensea-rarible-marble-cards-fraud-art) of artists having their artwork sold by impersonators. This is, in part, due to popular NFT platforms lacking a robust verification process for determining a creator’s identity.

The potential for fraud in the growing NFT market recently attracted the [attention](https://www.coindesk.com/fatfs-new-guidance) of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF)

* [Geo Web is connecting digital content to the physical world with NFTs and Ceramic](https://blog.ceramic.network/geo-web-is-connecting-digital-content-to-the-physical-world-with-nfts-and-ceramic/)

With DID:NFT, because the content that is anchored to a Geo Web parcel can actually be owned by the parcel itself, when someone buys the land they're also getting the infrastructure that's been built up on that land.

* [The future of Decentralized Identity: SSI vs NFTs](https://walt.id/decentralized-identity-explained/ssi-vs-nfts) Walt ID

While SSI has been developed to model digital identity, NFTs are used to model digital ownership. As a result, the concepts and technologies on which each approach is based differ with far reaching consequences. For example, while NFTs require blockchains, SSI can be used with or without them which is particularly important in the context of compliance and privacy.

What does decentralized, trustless, digital identity look like?

OR

Off-chain Verifiable Credentials?

Where will the future of Web3 identity live?

Some also worried that SBTs, given their potentially public, non-transferable qualities, could give rise to a Chinese-government-style “social credit system.” Others took shots at co-author Buterin personally, criticizing his “lack of understanding of the real world.”

if the signature is verified, we allow the minting to happen. When that's complete, we update the PREVIOUS_SIGNATURE variable. This is, as with many things in this demo, a simplified replay attack prevention model. This can and probably should be extended to support your own use cases.

Ultimately, each one of these will find their uses but care should be taken to avoid creating another scandal similar to Clearview AI where people release data into the world without being truly aware of the downsides it can create. Privacy, you don’t know what you got till it’s gone!
