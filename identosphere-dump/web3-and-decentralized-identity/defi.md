  > DIDs from a DeFi user VCs can be placed, anchored, indexed, and associated on the LTO chain. LTO Network solution is GDPR compliant and goes hand in hand with [ISO/TC307 - BLOCKCHAIN AND DISTRIBUTED LEDGER TECHNOLOGIES](https://www.iso.org/committee/6266604.html) . LTO Network approach uses Chainlink oracles for reaching the cross-chain operability and the Dutch company Sphereon for wallet integration.

Proposal: it’s not Web3 — it’s DeWeb (a la DeFi) as we undo all the mistakes around centralized ownership of the web 2 era. Opinions?

* [[…](https://twitter.com/InsideTheSim/status/1552636357373214722)] Bonus points — “de-web” sounds like “untangling a clusterfuck” which is exactly what it is.

* [[...](https://twitter.com/InsideTheSim/status/1552637214391156739)] DeWeb is: - Self-sovereign identity with portable accounts and easy sign-on (such as sign-in with Ethereum). - Custody of your own data and the ability to revoke access to it by 3rd parties. - Permission-less commerce rails. - Permission-less domains (ENS) - more?

“We want to use verifiable credentials as a way of identifying and proving identity, which is different from the current Aave model, for instance,” Lobban said. “Verifiable credentials are interesting because they can introduce the scale that you need to provide access to these pools without necessarily having to maintain a white list of addresses. Since verifiable credentials are not held on-chain, you don’t have the same overhead involved with writing this kind of information to blockchain, paying for [gas fees](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-are-ethereum-gas-fees/), etc.”
