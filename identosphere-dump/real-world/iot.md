As the world becomes even more connected and more machines are hooked up to the internet, the ability for machines to move, trade and interact securely and efficiently becomes increasingly important to life and business. Today’s centralized networks do not enable this. Machines today exist on closed, permission-based environments which massively limit which other machines can be interacted with, what machines can do and where they can go.

The rise in the use of advanced analytics, machine learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT) today have driven the technology of simulation into the concept of the digital twin. Digital twins are generally defined as a virtual digital model of a physical system that is used to make better decisions about the real world physical system. Digital twins are usually intertwined with sensors and include a two-way interaction between the physical and digital twin.

From memory:
I recall that Joe suggested simplification. I may not need to use ceramic and I may not need to use LoRa. I may not even need a blockchain or ledger. I may want to exchange public keys with friends to start out and use did:web.
Kim commented about her experience with BTCR. It was a great discussion. Unfortunately, it was not recorded.
When Brent mentioned a hackerspace and IoT use case using verifiable credentials to access machines that one had been trained on, Kim liked the idea.
Brent admitted that this was an exploratory project and there currently were no customers. Kim and (Joe) thought that working on a project was a good way to meet people.
Brent found it to be a productive way to learn about the technology. He admitted that he had not implemented verifiable credentials or completed a did method over ceramic. He admitted that he had only recently learned about the size issues of verifiable credentials on embedded devices from Mrinal from Ockam. He also mentioned that there was an earlier IIW session that talked about the size limitations of Lora: 200 bytes for LoRa and 150 bytes for LoraWAN. The title was similar to “ IoT swarms, communication in bandwidth constrained environments”.
Joe questioned why LoRa was used. Brent said it was legacy and the project originally started out through a suggestion from a friend to investigate LoRa and drone tracking (to satisfy a potential FAA regulation). He claimed to be unsure about it. He knew that the hobbyists had complained.
Joe suggested that other protocols could be fine, and there was a way that he recalled that ESP32 devices could form mesh networks (out of the box).
Then came discussion of OpenWRT. Brent thought Joe meant (wireless access points? softtAP?) with ESP32.
Discussion of did:web came up. Did:key was thought of as a good way forward (IIRC).  There were 3 things that joe mentioned to do, starting with authentication.

* [UX for AR, ambient identity, IoT? Human disclosure, consent, auth with devices.](https://iiw.idcommons.net/21J/_UX_for_AR,_ambient_identity,_IoT%253F_Human_disclosure,_consent,_auth_with_devices.) by Phil Wolff

Distrust of devices is rising. [https://wider.team/2021/04/21/resistiot/](https://wider.team/2021/04/21/resistiot/) IoT is being felt as the introduction of surveillance. “Devices are feared and distrusted as proxies for our distrust of the people and organizations behind them.” From the post:

- Clinical technology as workplace surveillance. Hospital providers talk about their frustration with connected technologies because it feels like their every motion is being monitored and tracked, used by bosses to evaluate their speed and cost efficiency.
- Civic technologies as government surveillance. From [Oakland’s corner traffic cameras](https://www.aclunc.org/blog/how-fight-stop-oaklands-domain-awareness-center-laid-groundwork-oakland-privacy-commission) leading to mass rallies to [Boston Police](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/robots-police-dog-spot-boston-dynamics-a9218491.html) [tests](https://reason.com/2019/11/26/massachusetts-police-test-out-robot-dogs-is-dystopia-on-its-way/) and [NYPD robot dogs](https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299140/nypd-boston-dynamics-spot-robot-dog), IoT is deep in the creepy depths of [the uncanny valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley).
- Consumer technology as commercial surveillance. Alexa, Google, and Apple know too much about you and use it to sell adjacent services.

Why these feelings?

- Devices project power into physical spaces where people live and work.
- Devices are opaque: they hide what happens downstream with device data and upstream with device control.

### Devices don’t put nearby-humans at the center of experience. “User experience” isn’t for them but designed by and for absent institutions. When exactly did Amazon Alexa last ask for your consent when you walked in a room? When did Google Nest ask for permission to send your picture to the cloud? What happened to the gigabytes of data produced during your colonoscopy? Who is looking and listening? What bots are judging your behavior or speech?

* [IoT Swarms + SSI in constrained networks](https://iiw.idcommons.net/12E/_IoT_Swarms_%252B_SSI_in_constrained_networks) by Geovane Fedrecheski

* [Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/15ix2vzR_Dq9xcs-8OY0qBjapy9dpY-WdRKph9SiEY-0/edit?usp%3Dsharing)

Summary: This session was a discussion about three topics: IoT Swarms, the challenges of SSI in constrained networks, and preliminary results on how to overcome them. The results showed that, while a DIDComm message with a DID Document as payload used almost 1 kilobyte, a binary approach can be used to cut it to just about 200 bytes.

IoT Swarms enable resource sharing among autonomous IoT devices. The presenter mentioned some papers published in this regard [1][2], including one that analyses using SSI in IoT and Swarm systems [3].

One of the challenges identified by this last paper is the overhead of using SSI, which poses a challenge for adoption on constrained IoT networks. For example, while the Long Range (LoRa) communication, often used in IoT systems, only allows payloads of up to 240 bytes, a single DID Document typically occupies 500 bytes or more. Similarly, messages using DIDComm tend to use at least 1 kilobyte, which prevents its use on constrained networks.

Figure 1. Binary versions of DIDComm and DID Documents are needed to allow transmission in LoRa networks. The payload, in blue, is a DID Document. The overhead, in orange, is the protocol overhead due to the message signature.

Mars, war zones, bad neighbors, Great Firewalls.](https://iiw.idcommons.net/11C/_Rugged_Identity:_resilience_for_Identity_of_Things_to_bad_latency,_signal,_power,_physical_integrity.) by Phil Wolff

Problem: So, what happens when you can’t call home to conduct an identity conversation? You’re on Mars and the latency is long. You’re in Haiti and the bandwidth is very limited during a storm. You’re in a war zone and your signal is noisy due to interference.

Rugged Identity is hoped-for resilience from very long latency, noisy signal, low bandwidth, interrupted connections, very low power computing and radio, power outages, and attacks on physical integrity like device tampering.

Using SSI, they can not only provide their machines with a decentralized and secure identity but also cover authentication and authorization through verifiable credentials issued on top of these identities. With this solution we built with Venafi, we can communicate or authenticate, authorize these devices, and prevent them from vulnerability to attack or counterfeit.

in our point of view, a lot of development groups are working in parallel on the similar topics, yet it is not clear what is going on inside. In this paper we will try to define the differences and discuss both pros and cons of using such commonly known technologies as Sovrin based upon the Hyperledger Indy technology, Civic, Jolocom, uPort and some others. Besides, we’ll tackle the idea of using the SSI for inanimate object and how it can be constructed in this way.

Managing IoT devices and user identities as well as the relationships among various devices and their digital twins face significant challenges. First, a lack of Identity Credential and Access Management (ICAM) standards for IoT creates proprietary standards and a lack of interoperability. Second, the operational lifecycle of IoT devices complicates integration of traditional ICAM. Lastly, ICAM technology must adapt to the proliferation of connected devices. This evolution requires a digital trust framework and the decentralized architecture of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI).

Devices are equipped by the manufacturer with an identity stored in a trusted execution environment (TEE) and secured by a blockchain. This identity can be used to trace back the origin of the device. During the bootstrapping process on the customer side, the identity registration of the device is updated in the blockchain. This process is performed by a so-called registrar. Smart contracts prevent unsolicited transfer of ownership and track the history of the device. Besides proof of origin and device security our concept can be used for device inventory and firmware upgrade.

Unlike a Wifi network, you don't put the network credentials in the device, you put the devices credentials (keys) in the network. Once I'd done that, the sensor started connecting to hotspots near my house and transmitting data. Today I've been driving around with it in my truck and it's roaming onto other hotspots as needed, still reporting temperatures.
