Web Interface Definition Language	This standard defines an interface definition language, Web IDL, that can be used to describe interfaces that are intended to be implemented in web browsers.	This standard defines an interface definition language, Web IDL, that can be used to describe interfaces that are intended to be implemented in web browsers. Web IDL is an IDL variant with a number of features that allow the behavior of common script objects in the web platform to be specified more readily. How interfaces described with Web IDL correspond to constructs within ECMAScript execution environments is also detailed here.
Concretely, Web IDL provides a syntax for specifying the surface APIs of web platform objects, as well as ECMAScript bindings that detail how those APIs manifest as ECMAScript constructs. This ensures common tasks, such as installing global properties, processing numeric inputs, or exposing iteration behavior, remain uniform across web platform specifications: such specifications describe their interfaces using Web IDL, and then use prose to specify API-specific details.	https://webidl.spec.whatwg.org/	non-core
DIF	BBS+ Signature Scheme	BBS is a digital signature scheme categorized as a form of short group signature that supports several unique properties. Notably, the scheme supports signing multiple messages whilst producing a single output digital signature. Through this capability, the possessor of a signature is able to generate proofs that selectively disclose subsets of the originally signed set of messages, whilst preserving the verifiable authenticity and integrity of the messages. Furthermore, these proofs are said to be zero-knowledge in nature as they do not reveal the underlying signature; instead, what they reveal is a proof of knowledge of the undisclosed signature.	https://identity.foundation/bbs-signature/draft-irtf-cfrg-bbs-signatures.html	core	MATTR	CFRG
CCG	RDF Dataset Normalization	RDF [RDF11-CONCEPTS] describes a graph-based data model for making claims about the world and provides the foundation for reasoning upon that graph of information.

This document outlines an algorithm for normalizing RDF datasets such that these operations can be performed.	https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-canon/	non-core

OMG ISSUES RFI FOR DISPOSABLE SELF-SOVEREIGN IDENTITY STANDARD	https://www.omg.org/news/releases/pr2021/01-21-21.htm	This RFI aims to gain a better understanding of the self-sovereign identity space. In particular, the Blockchain PSIG is exploring the potential for standards setting in the area of contextually constrained or ‘disposable’ self-sovereign identity arrangements, building on top of existing W3C standards for self-sovereign identity [DID] and verifiable credentials [VC]. The aim of this RFI is to determine whether new standards for this specific aspect of self-sovereign identity are necessary, desirable and timely, and are not already being developed elsewhere. (The RFI)	The Object Management Group® (OMG®) is an international, open membership, not-for-profit technology standards consortium, founded in 1989. OMG standards are driven by vendors, end-users, academic institutions and government agencies. OMG Task Forces develop enterprise integration standards for a wide range of technologies and an even wider range of industries.	OMG

Anonymous Credential Part 3: BBS+ Signature	https://medium.com/finema/anonymous-credential-part-3-bbs-signature-26797721ca74	Compared to the CL signature, the BBS+ signature has much shorter keys and signatures for a comparable level of security. As a result, the BBS+ signature enables fast implementation for anonymous credentials. It can be used in combination with signature proof of knowledge to hide some of credential attributes/messages in a zero-knowledge fashion.\n\n  > The BBS+ signature will also soon be available in [Finema](https://finema.co/)’s Identity Wallet! We are excited to see how this technology will make an impact to the society in the coming years.	Complimentary	BBS

After some consultation with Mattr and Transmute, we've settled on a base32 alphanumeric QR Code encoding that is 10% more  space efficient than base64url byte mode. This is important because this format is compatible with hundreds of QR Code readers on the market. Every QR Code reader that we've tested has worked with this new format.	Complimentary	CBOR

DHS SVIP PlugFest 2021 – Paper & Digital Vaccination Credentials 	https://youtu.be/fEBNGj377Vc	Complimentary	CBOR
Second demo video using a different potential flow: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEBNGj377Vc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEBNGj377Vc)\n\nPaper VC’s are hard to bring to parity with “digital VC’s”. The biggest issue is binding subject to holder and verifying that. There were also callouts on how do you prevent replication.\n \n Traditionally, QR codes with the entire VC can be put onto a piece of paper. We proposed compression on those QR codes using CBOR-LD that reduces size of codes by 50%.\n \n Alternative ways include adding VC’s into NFC chips and adding the NFC identifier as a claim to the VC preventing duplication. There is a cost overhead to this compared to paper but is a cost potentially worth occurring.	Complimentary	CBOR
