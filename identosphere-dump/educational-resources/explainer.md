* [Kaliya Young on Identikit with Michelle Dennedy](https://identitywoman.net/podcast-identikit-with-michelle-dennedy/)

our latest series examining the evolution of digital identity, and how self-sovereign identity, specifically, can advance a consent-based economy.
* [The Architecture of Identity Systems](https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/09/the_architecture_of_identity_systems.shtml) by Phil Windley 
    > I recently read a paper from Sam Smith, [Key Event Receipt Infrastructure](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.02143), that provided inspiration for a way to think about and classify identity systems. In particular his terminology was helpful to me. This blog post uses terminology and ideas from Sam's paper to classify and analyze three different identity system architectures. I hope it provides a useful model for thinking about identity online.
* [The SSO Practitioner’s Introduction to Decentralized Identity](https://www.pingidentity.com/en/resources/blog/post/sso-practitioners-introduction-decentralized-identity.html)
*Written for IAM professionals familiar with federations.*
  > In most self-sovereign and decentralized identity systems the trust model is  fundamentally unidirectional, where a verifier will trust the issuer, but the issuer may have no knowledge of the verifier.
* [Relationships and Identity](https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/07/relationships_and_identity.shtml), We build digital identity systems to create and manage relationships—not identities. 
* [The Architecture of Identity Systems](https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/09/the_architecture_of_identity_systems.shtml) 
  >  We can broadly classify identity systems into one of three types based on their architectures and primary root of trust:
  > - Administrative
  > - Algorithmic
  > - Autonomic
* [Authentic Digital Relationships](https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/08/authentic_digital_relationships.shtml),   
  > Self-sovereign identity, supported by a heterarchical identity metasystem, creates a firm foundation for rich digital relationships that allow people to be digitally embodied so they can act online as autonomous agents.
* [Do we really need (or want) the State to provide us with digital identification?](https://www.libertarianism.org/articles/self-sovereign-identity-blockchain-age)   
  > Just as the State still manages our “analog” identities, the online giants have vast power to manage the online data and identity of their users. Internet users are now both consumer and product: by using free online services, users feed companies with data, which those companies in turn process and monetize.
* [How Decentralized Identifiers Will Shape the Future of Identity](https://hackernoon.com/how-decentralized-identifiers-will-shape-the-future-of-identity-iam3w9g) HackerNoon
  > Hackers value personal information the most. 96% of hacking groups’ primary motive is intelligence gathering. Researchers at privacy website PrivacyAffairs.com found that you can obtain a person's full identity for the low price of $1,275.
* [Self Sovereign Identity — explained](https://micha-roon.medium.com/self-sovereign-identity-explained-f5380c08e446) Micha Roon
  > It would be great indeed if digital interactions became even more trustworthy without the need to present our data on a silver platter to large Internet corporations
* [Self-Sovereign vs Administrative Identity](http://blogs.harvard.edu/vrm/2012/03/25/ssi/) Doc Searls 2012
  > The problem I’m trying to surface here is that we need full respect for self-sovereign identities, and identifiers, before we can solve the problem of highly fractured and incompatible administrative identifiers — a problem that has only become worse with the growth of the Web, where by design we are always the submissive and dependent party: calves to administrative cows.
* [@lissi_id and the three-sided credentials market](https://twitter.com/lissi_id/status/1334834875896004608)
  > When a user holds his:her own credentials locally on the phone, it creates a three-sided market, which puts the holder of the credential in the position of a carrier between issuer and verifiers.
  * [Security, Silos, and Sovereignty](https://daniel-hardman.medium.com/security-silos-and-sovereignty-522e30bb8eb4)

Why portable security is the sleeper — but killer — feature for SSI

what’s cool about DIDs (besides their self-service creation) is that their metadata is cryptographically verifiable. That means that anyone in the world can tell whether the metadata is legit, in the blink of an eye, just by asking software to check some math. And it also means that you can build a transport-independent, tamper-proof, encrypted communication channel with whoever controls a DID.

* [Identity Credential and Personal Data Ownership Perspectives](https://openidentityexchange.org/networks/87/item.html?id=404) Research from OIX
  > Many global organisations are using their citizens’ identity and their other personally identifiable information (PII) to help combat the global Covid-19 crisis  […] reignited the debate around protecting public safety vs protecting privacy:  how to combat the contagious threat whilst preserving citizens’ digital identity, security and anonymity?
* [The Mental Models of Identity Enabled by SSI](https://ssi-ambassador.medium.com/the-mental-models-of-identity-enabled-by-ssi-d3e2d8d0f2b6) Adrian Doerk 
The Models: Space Time • Presentation • Attribute • Relationship • Capability

* [Digging Deeper into Self-sovereign Identity and Access Management](https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/digging-deeper-into-self-sovereign-identity-and-access-management-e6eefbac631e)  Energy Web Foundation
  > What we’d like to highlight in this simplified process is the fact that it is the user who stores the claim and anchors it on chain. Also, because it is a private claim, the contents are provable but not disclosed. The user can therefore prove that they have been granted a certain privilege, but unless they elect to disclose this information, it is impossible for a third party to find out.
* [The Implications of Bring Your Own Identity](https://www.idsalliance.org/blog/2020/12/03/the-implications-of-bring-your-own-identity/) Identity Defined Security Alliance
  > My short stint as “Mark Jannell" taught me a lot of about trust and ease of use in a bring your own identity model. Trust, as always in security, is essential to this new class of relationships and must be established and then protected from abuse. Ease of use, it turns out, is a key factor in protecting that trust and promoting the adoption of good identity patterns. I’m sure that I could have learned these lessons in some other way, but I’ll never forget my half year answering to a pseudonym.
* [Blockchain is the Least Interesting Thing About Self-sovereign Identity](https://medium.com/trinsic/blockchain-is-the-least-interesting-thing-about-self-sovereign-identity-75c1b56ce497) Riley Huges

  > - The benefits of technical standards
  > - The economic opportunity for early innovators
* [Decentralized identity discussed: An INATBA roundtable round-up](https://jolocom.io/blog/decentralized-identity-inatba-roundtable/)

We pointed to this before it happened. It was great. Here is a round up from Jolocom. It is highly recommended.

> The paper Decentralised Identity: What’s at Stake?. Answering the paper’s core question of what’s at stake, it gives three essential scenarios:
> 1. Ideal – full convergence of SSI technology with interoperability by default.
> 2. Functional – partial convergence resulting in detached ecosystems.
> 3. Dysfunctional – no convergence and isolated, locked-in ecosystems.
* [Who Controls Your Digital Identity?](https://blogs.sap.com/2021/02/18/who-controls-your-digital-identity/) SAP
  > SSI will have to be integrated with large existing business processes – and therefore enterprise systems such as ERPs, HCMs, or SCMs to name a few. If this integration results in SSI being as easy to use as clicking a button or selecting a menu item, it will lead to rapid uptake and acceptance.
* [The 5P’s of a Self-Sovereign Identity](https://markvanrijmenam.medium.com/the-5ps-of-a-self-sovereign-identity-e6f6eb802d75)
  > A self-sovereign identity can be defined by the 5P’s as it is personal (it is about you), portable (meaning you can take your identity and data from one platform to another), private (you control your identity and data), persistent (it does not change without your consent) and protected (they cannot steal your identity).
* [Benefits of SSI and Blockchain in Digital Identity](https://www.good-id.org/en/articles/benefits-of-ssi-and-blockchain-in-digital-identity/)
  > The needs and experiences of citizens are established with how digital identity networks should preserve the freedoms and rights of users over the needs of the network. Transparency is explicitly mentioned as part of SSI, and it places a high emphasis on the importance of the public’s trust.
  > 
  > As we look to the future of digital identity, SSI principles with blockchain have already proven to be successful by bringing together stakeholders to create a mutually beneficial network.

  > This article is very very good in articulating the big picture of how SSI systems relative to older system and emerging fragmetned systems.

An answer to these challenges is an ecosystem in which digital identity data can be exchanged in a way that is secure, reliable, scalable and convenient. This will have a positive impact on the economic future of Germany and Europe while at the same time enhancing the private sphere of the individual.

  > So why DLT? First, we can get the good parts of paper credentials—private transactions between holders and verifiers and no callback to the issuer. Second, the issuer gets a trusted, open and transparent way to publish the cryptographic material needed for those private holder-verifier transactions. Third, there is no need to have a “Trusted Third Party” participating in the interactions.

Identifiers, DID, ion

- Decentralization of did:ion if anchoring transactions are batched by an operator: it’s possible to choose the operator or to incur the cost of anchoring the transactions. Furthermore, the operator doesn’t gain access to the private key.
- ION delivers: massive scale, cost efficiency (despite running on the bitcoin network - best case if bitcoin a transaction costs 100 USD one action costs 1 cent), decentralized & flexible, decentralized registries
- ION has a type system so that DIDs can be used, e.g. for software packages, vehicles, … This makes it possible to make the centralized data repositories that we rely on today, npm registries etc., to be fully decentralized. This is a Sidetree feature that is currently only used by ION.
- DIF is currently working on personal data stores. Expected impact on private messaging, social media, gig services, ..
- ION is live and in production today
- Ion-tools is a selection of tools to interact with the ION network: [https://github.com/decentralized-identity/ion-tools](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/ion-tools)
- Resilience of ION: It’s pointed out that not only Bitcoin needs to survive attacks but also the IPFS network as both are required for ION to work properly. With Bitcoin it looks unlikely that it’s currently possible to reverse transactions on the network. However, with IPFS data can be unpinned and potentially disappear from the network.

In chaotic systems such as those that the discipline of physics seeks to describe, there is also the concept of the “self-organizing principle,” which dictates a tendency for chaotic systems to organize themselves. While this might be a tendency in physics, organization usually needs a nudge in the right direction in the identity world.

In this May 2019 blog post, the benefits (The good) of SSI are illustrated with a range of examples, comparing SSI-based business transactions to their current non-SSI-based equivalents and thus more cumbersome.

In addition, examples are given of the disadvantages (The bad); how SSI technology can be misused by unscrupulous organizations and how a combination of technology, knowledge and legislation could mitigate this risk.

Finally, we give examples of the harmful side (The ugly); how SSI technology can be used by criminals and what countermeasures are possible.

Self-sovereign identity Definition <-its quite good

Self-sovereign identity (SSI) is rooted in the belief that individuals have the right to an identity independent of reliance on a third-party identity provider, such as the state or any other central authority. Its implementation requires the development of technical standards, as well as socio-political adaptations rooted in legal amendments in order to be successful.

* [#SSI101: An Introductory Course on Self-Sovereign Identity](https://medium.com/spherity/ssi101-an-introductory-course-on-self-sovereign-identity-the-spherity-way-19e0d1de3603) Spherity

Outside of a few philosophers, social scientists, and a tiny minority of specialized technologists, however, most people feel uncomfortable making any definitive or authoritative statements about identity.

Unlike the existing system, it’s a user-centric and user-controlled approach to exchanging authentic data in a much more secure way. Authentic data is information that’s source can be proven.

* [Self-sovereign identity: Why blockchain?](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/blockchain/2018/06/self-sovereign-identity-why-blockchain/) Dan Gisolfi, IBM

blockchain provides a transparent, immutable, reliable and auditable way to address the seamless and secure exchange of cryptographic keys. To better understand this position, let us explore some foundational concepts.

Decentralized digital identities are only possible due to cryptography. One of the cornerstones is asymmetric encryption. A key pair is generated using a cryptographic process. The pair consists of a public and a private key. As the names suggest, the private key must remain private and the public key can be shared.

The third approach is, in a way, derived from the previous one, and is the one pursued by [uPort/Serto](https://www.uport.me/): the blockchain has one single registry that tracks down just the revocation of credentials,

* [The Buzz Behind Zero Trust](https://stateofidentity.libsyn.com/zero-trust-architecture) State of Identity

The Zero Trust model is the belief that no one should be trusted from inside or outside your network, until their identity has been verified.

* [Identities Evolve: Why Federated Identity is Easier Said than Done](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id%3D2163241) SSRN

This paper shows that federated identity is really a radical and deeply problematic departure from the way we do routine business. Federation undoes and complicates long standing business arrangements, exposing customers and service providers alike to new risks that existing contracts are unable to deal with. Identity federations tend to overlook that identities are proxies for relationships we have in different contexts. Business relationships don’t easily “interoperate."

they offer a few advantages that we don’t get with paper records. Whereas a physical document (let’s say, a [vaccine card](https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2021/06/15/vaccine-passports/)) can be forged and [passed off as authentic](https://www.npr.org/2021/06/08/1004264531/fake-covid-vaccine-cards-keep-getting-sold-online-using-one-is-a-crime?t%3D1626423870877), the [security mechanisms](https://www.evernym.com/blog/the-three-pillars-of-self-sovereign-identity/) behind a verifiable credential means that it can never be tampered with and that anyone shown the credential will be able to immediately verify who issued it and to whom it was issued.

* [Selective Disclosure: Share Just What You Want](https://academy.affinidi.com/selective-disclosure-share-what-you-want-8ae367655b7b) Affinidi

In the context of SSI, selective disclosure is best implemented through [verifiable credentials](https://academy.affinidi.com/what-are-verifiable-credentials-79f1846a7b9) where the user has separate credentials for each piece of information such as his/her date of birth, full name, vaccination details, address, passport number, etc.

Meanwhile, digital platforms have replaced markets as the locus of private wealth extraction. For the first time in history, almost everyone produces for free the capital stock of large corporations. That is what it means to upload stuff on Facebook or move around while linked to Google Maps…. But while capitalism may end with a whimper, the bang may soon follow.

I reckon most cases of over-identification stem either from bad habits (e.g. RPs gathering circumstantial AuthN signals) or from Surveillance Capitalism. Either way, better deals for users will come from better design, not by weaponising Digital Identity (SSI, DIDs).

In “Self-Sovereign Identity,” [Johannes Sedlmeir](https://www.fim-rc.de/Paperbibliothek/Veroeffentlicht/1359/wi-1359.pdf) makes a clear distinction between two concepts too often mixed: “identity” and “identifiers”. What we are experiencing in today’s Web are some external organizations identifying us as citizens, community members, customers, etc. But this isn’t our “identity.” Those are identifiers.

Decentralized identity (DID) is a way for users to own their identity, using specific credentials to verify their identity to applications. These credentials, called Verifiable Credentials, enable you to do this. Verifiable Credentials are identity attestations that come from a trusted issuer, like proof of a workplace, student IDs, or official memberships.

This series is intended to be a basic, easy-to-understand introduction to SSI, but for a much deeper dive, check out Hypersign Labs — our technical blog. Here’s a good place to start on SSI:

* [Digital Identity: Past; Present; Future](https://labs.hypersign.id/posts/ssi-intro/) Hypersign

As a result of limited and known users there was no layer of identity and authentication in the design of internet framework. With the invention of the World Wide Web (WWW), the users made it a common platform for data sciences. Various sectors of society like health and finance have started using the internet for their services.

* [What Is Self-Sovereign Identity?](https://trinsic.id/what-is-self-sovereign-identity/) Trinsic

Eventually, SSI will give people a super simple way to do the following and more:

1. Protect sensitive identity information like SSN and birthdates to reduce the likelihood and impact of identity theft
2. Securely prove your identity or things about yourself in a way that institutions can trust
3. Maintain privacy and reduce the ability for corporations or nefarious actors to track you without your consent
4. Conveniently get access to services you need without usernames and passwords
* [Crossfunctionality](https://docs.centre.io/blog/crossfunctionationality) Centre

I have developed a pet peeve for "technosolutionism": the notion that a sufficiently innovative technology can solve a social problem, or a business problem, without complex and nuanced changes to social and business practice.

* [What does ‘open’ mean to you?](https://blog.weareopen.coop/what-does-open-mean-to-you-cec90dff6845) WeAreOpenCoop

Even with a little bit of input and discussion, you can see the shift to words such as ‘inclusivity’ and phrases such as ‘being more accessible’ or ‘getting everyone involved’.

* [The Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) Basics](https://santandergto.com/en/the-self-sovereign-identity-ssi-basics-what-is-it/) Santanderigo

The very center of the digital identity is your documents: from your National ID or Passport to your degrees, mobile phone number, bank account number, or your medical records. Anything that is intrinsically bound to you is your data and therefore your identity. While talking about SSI these are called Verifiable Credentials (VC).

* [What is decentralized identity?](https://www.csoonline.com/article/3665692/what-is-decentralized-identity.html) In CSO

The DID model allows you to establish a relationship between your private key (your blockchain wallet) and your citizenship.  The issuing authority signs off on the truth of your claim and, thereafter, third parties can check your public key to see that the holder of the private key is in fact a British citizen.

The public keys, as the name implies are there to view anytime and are used for exchanging information and can be revoked, however, the private key is for the account holder himself, be that an issuer, a verifier, or a subject. It is only through a private key that one can pass on his credentials using his DID to an issuer who then validates the credentials and sends them to the verifier using his DID.
