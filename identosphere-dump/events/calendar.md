At EIC, we could learn who are the key enablers and drivers of the evolution: the European Digital Identity (EUDI) program that is transforming Europe’s digital identity, mDL that enables driver’s license digitalisation, EBSI that established a framework for trusted verifiable credentials exchange, OpenID Connect’s work on standardisation of Verifiable Credentials exchange, Global Assured Identity Network (GAIN) authentication and identification with highest assurance levels on a global scale, Open Identity Exchange (OIX) for assurance-level and policy matching and mapping, TrustOverIP (ToIP) for the next-generation trusted internet, and others. Global trust, assurance, interoperability and user-centric identity are vital elements that lead to an open digital identity.
