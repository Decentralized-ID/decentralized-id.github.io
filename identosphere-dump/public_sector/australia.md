- The international digital identity industry has moved comprehensively towards decentralised verifiable credentials and strong client-side authentication tools (especially through the [FIDO Alliance](https://fidoalliance.org/); Australia needs to catch up with these standards.
- The Australian states are implementing digitised credentials at a rapid rate, refocusing from Who a citizen is, to What attributes and claims they need to prove online; DTA risks being left behind by these developments.

Government should adopt a simple, existing standard for its digital ID system, such as the public-key infrastructure (PKI)-based system in use within many [European countries](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/csirts-in-europe/glossary/public-key-infrastructure-pki). PKI offers a number of security and privacy benefits that the TDIF aims to have; however, as no central authority is involved in authentication, no entity can meaningfully track user activity.

Yikes!

For those that didn't read the article, the TL;DR is:

Tough to forge digital driver’s license is… easy to forge... 4 million mobile driver's licenses in NSW Australia compromised in an unrecoverable way.
