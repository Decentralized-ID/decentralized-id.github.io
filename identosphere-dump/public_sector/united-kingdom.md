Until now, the [eIDAS regulation](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/eur/2014/910/contents) has only focused on online identification. However, the new proposal – eIDAS 2.0 – aims to extend identity to the world of physical services which can be accessed from anywhere around the globe.

* [“](https://www.biometricupdate.com/202103/uk-government-runs-new-digital-id-system-pilot-for-public-services)[The next iteration of the framework](https://www.biometricupdate.com/202103/uk-government-runs-new-digital-id-system-pilot-for-public-services) mentioned earlier is due to be published this summer and I look forward to that. It will be essential for that work to not only be underpinned by the twelve guiding principles but also to swiftly ‘sandbox’, stand up parallel proofs in specific sectors and proceed with pace.”

Digital access to the attributes these documents contain can solve these issues. It can also have benefits such as improving inclusion. If you do not have a passport, perhaps another government service can validate your age. There are also opportunities for data minimisation by disclosing only that information which is required (for example, that you’re over 18), rather than full disclosure of your data, including your date of birth, name, or address.
