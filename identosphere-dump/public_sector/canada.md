* [Canada: Enabling Self-Sovereign Identity](https://trbouma.medium.com/canada-enabling-self-sovereign-identity-efcfda2aa044) Tim Bouma

The adoption of the [self-sovereign identity model](http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2016/04/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity.html) within the Canadian public sector is still being realized in 2020. It is too early to tell how it will change the technological infrastructure or the institutional infrastructure of Canadian public services.

[Ontario 2022 Election Results](https://www.continuumloop.com/digital-id-can-increase-voter-participation/)

It would be an understatement if I said that I was disappointed with the Ontario 2022 election results, and I’m not talking about the winning party – I’m talking about the turnout. All to say, it’s discouraging to see such low participation. [...] I’m not an expert on the election process, and this is just my opinion. I’ve been lazy in past elections, and I’d be lying if I said I’ve voted in every one. As a citizen, I believe ease and accessibility have a lot to do with it.

The Lab is Canada’s first independent and neutral organization to promote the compliance of and interoperability between digital ID solutions across public and private sectors, bridging a crucial gap in the advancement of Canada’s digital ecosystem.

In a search that started in October 2021, the province was considering vendors to potentially initiate digital ID, meant to replace the need for physical ID cards. According to RFP documents, the selected vendor would have worked with SGI for facial verification, but final details on accessing the photo database weren’t finalized.

Canada is beginning to develop their own version of a “[Tell Us Once](https://digitalcanada.io/tell-us-once-legislation/)” Digital Identity policy, an approach pioneered in Europe by the likes of Estonia.

This is a policy where having provided your data to one government agency, you’ll never be asked for it again from another, defined explicitly through legislation.

The proof of concept stage is where the Canadian government tests digital credentials use cases in cooperation with regulators and organizations to advance the adoption and maturity of digital credentials technology. The National Digital Trust Service aims to enable Canadians and businesses to issue, use and verify digital credentials during transactions.

* [Ontario’s Digital ID: Technology and standards](https://www.ontario.ca/page/ontarios-digital-id-technology-and-standards)

Ontario’s Digital ID will use self-sovereign identity because it gives the holder control over the credentials in their wallet. In addition, we are layering on these extra privacy-preserving features:

- Consent – The verifier must ask you to approve their request to confirm your credentials.
- Data minimization – The verifier can only access what they need to confirm you are eligible for their service. For example, if you need to prove that you are old enough to buy a lottery ticket, the store clerk would only know that you are 18 or older – not your actual age, birth date or anything else about you.
- Anonymity – Your credentials are not tracked or traced.

  > “a document that provides a set of agreed-upon rules, guidelines or characteristics for activities or their results. Standards establish accepted practices, technical requirements, and terminologies for diverse fields.”  He goes on to highlight a lot of the work being done in Canada and where it all sits relative to being a standard - “In closing, there are lots of trust frameworks being developed today. But to be truly trusted, a trust framework needs to either apply existing standards or become a standard itself.”
