While the structural difference between SSI approaches and conventional centralised or federated eID schemes is, on one level, profound (full control over data and identity with the user; no third-party intermediary between the user and the service provider), on another level, these differences may also appear highly abstract to ordinary users. What societal and economic consequences they may unfold remains, so far, little understood, also because research on the real social and economic effects of SSI solutions is only beginning.

It needs to be involved to enable access to public services, adapt legislature and guarantee equal access for its citizens. However, it should not be able to control or monitor all aspects and activities of its citizens.

Each project's private and public sector partners was given early access to the pre-production environment of EBSI, and was invited to develop their own pilot project to address a specific business or government use case involving the exchange of verifiable credentials.

With the help with the EBSI team, Early Adopters can identify how to connect their systems, be part of a community and collaborate with other Early Adopters. This will help us improve EBSI's services and ensure it meets the needs of Europe's businesses and public administrations, within and across borders.

The concept of digital identification is already well established, and using a smartphone to board a plane or prove vaccination status is second nature to many millions of people. In the EU however, while many states have made electronic identification available and domestic use is growing, the development of internationally accepted electronic identity (eID) systems has been piecemeal and inconsistent.

What we've found as a good framework is the concept of "Principal Authority" which comes from the Laws of Agency, which allows us to leverage fiduciary style Laws of Custom to define requirements for practices when digital identity is delegated to others (whether for authorization or for use of data).

I've written up a layman's article (as I am not a lawyer) introducing this topic at:
