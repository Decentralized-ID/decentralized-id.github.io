  > Privacy gets too little emphasis from some participants in the decentralized identity movement. They claim to value confidential interactions, yet advocate that individuals create public decentralized identifiers (DIDs) on the blockchain (ignoring legal warnings about DIDs being PII). They are okay with “phone home” verifications of credentials and revocation and capabilities.

we’ll be able to share more about our new work at Avast over the coming months. In the meantime, there are several great posts on the Avast blog that show the combined thinking of the Avast, Evernym, and SecureKey teams:
* [Introducing the Evernym Mobile SDK](https://www.evernym.com/blog/evernym-mobile-sdk/)

Today’s release was made possible with the help of many of our incredible customers who have participated in the product’s beta. It’s through your feedback that we’ve been able to iterate, refine, and ultimately launch a product that will help make self-sovereign identity more accessible to all.

* Evernym: [September 2021 Release Notes](https://www.evernym.com/blog/september-2021-release-notes/)

The most important changes are:

- A fee will be charged on a regular basis to remain an endorser on either MainNet or StagingNet.
- In addition to the endorser fee, write fees will now be charged for transactions on Sovrin StagingNet in a similar fashion to the existing fees on Sovrin MainNet.
- The current [Sovrin Self Serve website](https://selfserve.sovrin.org/) will stop being used to become an endorser on StagingNet, and instead endorsers will be charged a fee after registering.

Avast’s product suite ranges from VPNs, antivirus, anti-tracking, monitoring of personal information potentially affected by data breaches, and so on. Evernym enables user-centric identity, where the individual user holds, controls, and shares their identity data in a privacy-preserving way.

They are using a [Business Source License](https://perens.com/2017/02/14/bsl-1-1/), which has some commercial restrictions, that eventually give way to open use. * [Evernym Joins with Other Solution Providers to Achieve Interoperability Milestone](https://www.evernym.com/blog/evernym-joins-with-other-solution-providers-to-achieve-interoperability-milestone/)
