Verification is done on-chain through Algorand, which bills itself as a solution to the [blockchain trilemma](https://www.google.com/search?q%3Dalgorand%2Btrilemma%26oq%3Dalgorand%2Btrilem%26aqs%3Dchrome.0.0i512j69i57j0i390.2391j0j9%26sourceid%3Dchrome%26ie%3DUTF-8) of security, scalability and decentralization. FlexID will also be integrating with other Algorand decentralized apps (dApps).
