* [IOTA Identity: Beta Release](https://blog.iota.org/iota-identity-beta-release/)

The first major feature we introduced with this beta release is the account, a higher-level API to use IOTA Identity. Similar to the recent Chrysalis update, IOTA Identity becomes a lot easier to use by utilizing the account. It is intended to provide a much more simplified interface that is perfect for 90%+ of the use cases. The other 10% are more complex use cases that may still want to utilize the lower-level APIs to have more control over the Identities. The account doesn’t just simplify the interactions with DID Documents, but also with the Tangle and Stronghold.
