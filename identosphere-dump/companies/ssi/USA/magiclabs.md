Magic Login Form represents a new onboarding experience for end-users, so we wanted to revamp our own onboarding experience for developers to match. Learning about auth can quickly derail any developer’s good day. Striking the balance between good UX and good security can just boggle the mind.

At Magic, we love to be where developers hang out. As a Developer Advocate, it’s especially fun to connect with devs dreaming up big ideas and hacking them into reality. Back in April, the HackOn2.0 team reached out to me to talk about getting Magic involved in their next hackathon. We jumped at the opportunity and were so glad to support the HackOn2.0’s vibrant community.

I’ll cover how the Decrypt team streamlined development and onboarding to launch Decrypt Tokens and Drops — along with how crypto DNA and a leading product and team drove their trust in Magic.


* [Magic: A Key-Based Authentication System For Self-Sovereign Identity](https://www.dropbox.com/s/3flqaszoigwis5b/Magic%2520Whitepaper.pdf?dl%3D0)

Since Magic’s authentication protocol is based on key pairs provided by decentralized blockchain networks, it is platform-independent and thus able to provide authentication service without having to rely on centralized identity providers.

Magic makes it plug and play for developers to add secure, passwordless login, like magic links and WebAuthn, to their applications. Users are no longer exposed to password-related risks from the very start.
