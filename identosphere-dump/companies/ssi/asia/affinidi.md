There is a big need for solutions to enable trusted interactions, especially when it comes to identification and authentication. It all stems from the fact that the [Internet](https://academy.affinidi.com/web-2-0-vs-web-3-0-a-bridge-between-the-past-and-the-future-c99668c1e2f0) was never designed for identities of individuals in the first place. Though we have standards and protocols for transactions, these are not constructed to enable the average user control of his or her digital identity without depending on a single third party.
