The implementation of the electronic signature was a major development in the development in management.

99% of our documents are digitally signed digitally and we have eliminated many face-to-face meetings.

* [​The time for the EIDAS bridge](http://validatedid.com/post-en/the-time-for-the-eidas-bridge)There’s an outstanding question, for us, around how this community explores and thinks about the theoretical underpinnings of a Community of Practice (CoP), but one thing is for sure, Keep Badges Weird is a CoP.

if you wonder how many of us, users, can really take advantage of PKI for identifying ourselves on the internet, the answer is quite deceiving. This mature technology has been available for decades but has never become mainstream among the society for identifying end users.

* [The time for the eIDAS Bridge](http://validatedid.com/post-en/the-time-for-the-eidas-bridge) ValidatedID

The main goal of this new program was to provide an implementation of eIDAS bridge and to proof the interoperability between different provider implementations. Validated ID was selected to participate in part of the Call 1 of infrastructure. The results of this project are available as open source. If you are interested in digging into the code, you can find it all in the following repositories: [our open source version implementation](https://gitlab.grnet.gr/essif-lab/infrastructure/validated-id/seb) and the [SSI eIDAS Bridge interoperability](https://gitlab.grnet.gr/essif-lab/interoperability/ssi-eidas-bridge) performed with SICPA.

* [Validated ID's journey to becoming EBSI compliant](https://www.validatedid.com/post-en/validated-ids-journey-to-becoming-ebsi-compliant)

We at Validated ID have been betting on EBSI since the beginning. We started working to become conformant wallet providers since the very first version of [Wallet Conformance Tests (WCT)](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/wikis/display/EBSI/EBSI%2Bwallets) was published. The process of preparing our solution to become conformant has allowed us to appreciate how remarkable EBSI's work has been.

Do you know the story of Carlos Kaiser? He was a professional Brazilian football player [that never played a single match](https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2017/apr/26/the-forgotten-story-of-carlos-kaiser-footballs-greatest-conman) but managed to still have a professional football career. He wanted the lifestyle without having to do the work.
