It's Verim in New clothes. Kaliya still doesn’t like this model. Requiring verifiers to pay issuers is really really privacy problematic.

We want to provide a common and public infrastructure easily accessible to anyone and any organisation that provides B2B and B2B2C payment rails between issuers, holders, and receivers of trusted data. [...] cheqd is not and does not plan on dictating a single payment model. Rather, our product vision is to enable each ecosystem to decide this on their own through [Layer 1 vs Layer 2 mechanisms](https://blog.verim.id/self-sovereign-identity-semantics-an-economic-extension-to-the-trust-over-ip-stack-4a4197d8f6d3) and customisable tokenomics.

While self-sovereign identity (SSI) sounds like an unfamiliar concept for some, others are actively leveraging the technology to address industry-specific challenges — take the KYC trial of the [Financial Conduct Authority](https://www.evernym.com/blog/evernym-accepted-into-fca-regulatory-sandbox/) or the [IATA Travel Pass.](https://www.iata.org/en/pressroom/pr/2020-12-16-01/)
* [Our Approach to Resources on-ledger](https://blog.cheqd.io/our-approach-to-resources-on-ledger-25bf5690c975): Using the capabilities of the DID Core specification for standards-compliant resource lookup

Decentralised Identifiers (DIDs): are often stored on ledgers (e.g., [cheqd](https://github.com/cheqd/node-docs/blob/adr-008-resources-updates/architecture/adr-list/adr-002-cheqd-did-method.md), [Hyperledger Indy](https://hyperledger.github.io/indy-did-method/), distributed storage (e.g., [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) in [Sidetree](https://identity.foundation/sidetree/spec/)), or non-ledger distributed systems (e.g., [KERI](https://keri.one/)). Yet, DIDs can be stored on traditional centralised-storage endpoints (e.g., [did:web](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-web/), [did:git](https://github-did.com/)).

Besides an exciting front side of virtual reality (VR) element that everybody could at least vaguely relate to, there are a lot of other interesting developments, particularly around the digital economy and trusted interactions enabled through digital and self-sovereign identity (SSI).

We know that many communities are desirably and rightly passionate about their adopted protocols. We are not taking shots at any of the ones discussed below, which we didn’t take forward; we only want to explain our thinking and why we see using Cosmos as a massive boon for us.
