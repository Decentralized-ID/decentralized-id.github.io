  > Katryna believes that it is vital for the future of the internet that people and organisations obtain control of their data. This concept is called ‘data sovereignty’, but achieving that means rethinking the digital infrastructure the current internet is built upon. She calls for a soft infrastructure that consists of agreements between public and private-sector parties about the access to data.

The compelling data and research suggest that my original question now needs to be reframed. People most certainly do care about their data privacy. The question now is: how are organisations going to bridge this data privacy chasm?

  > Together, Meeco and VELA have created a secure digital credentialing platform to help individuals and businesses adapt to the changing work environment and modernise their HR practices.
* [EU Data Governance Act](https://blog.meeco.me/eu-data-governance-act/) (Meeco)
  > We welcome the regulation as a needed common ground for clarifying the role of data intermediaries, building trust in these intermediaries and setting the direction for data governance, including the emergence of digital human rights.
> 
> In this context we offer the following suggestions:
> 1. Explicitly include individuals as active participants in the definitions [...]
> 2. Clarify the scope of the data sharing services (Art. 9 (2)) and extend it to include services that empower the data subject beyond compliance.
> 3. Foster the growth of intermediaries, which offer new technologies and have the greatest likelihood of success in Europe if supported by the Data Governance Act.
> 4. Open silos and implement soft infrastructure such as standards & open APIs to accelerate uptake and interoperability between data sharing services.
> 5. Foster eco-systems and demonstrate the value through practical use-cases.
> 6. Create a level playing field for sustainable data sharing by providing funding to pioneers at the forefront of developing data eco-systems
