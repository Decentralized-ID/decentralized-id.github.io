Marketplace deception is everywhere, at great cost and risk to consumers and businesses. Regulation alone won’t fix it. Can Mattereum Asset Passports and Product Information Markets help secure trust in B2B and B2C trade?

With product information markets enabled by Trust Communities, we can incentivize truth in markets by allowing experts to make money on their expertise and face consequences for erroneous claims. Simple concept, powerful implications.

So while the blockchain space is in some abstract sense perfectly private and perfectly reliable, things are weakest at the joints. The on-ramps and off-ramps are parts of the real world, they’re tied to physical reality and KYC/AML/CTF regulations.

Any system connected to the real world is going to have some of the problems of the real world connected to it too. That’s just life.

Vinay: My history goes back to the 1990s. I was involved very heavily in the kind of cypherpunk movement in the ’90s. My first year where 100% of my salary went through crypto cash was 1999, so ‘99/2000 I got a full year of salary in crypto cash.

Ian Grigg is one of the most influential builders in the crypto space, having built digital asset systems since the nineties. We discuss his invention of the Ricardian contract framework, what makes cryptonetworks successful, identity as communal phenomenon, and the importance of building positive-sum systems.

crypto wins by solving problems that nobody else can solve, profitably. It has to win at three levels to survive:

- Ordinary people have to use it
- It has to generate actual value, not just move value around
- Governments have to tolerate it or use it themselves — either one will do

VR is not ready for artistic reasons, far more than for technical ones.

So my prediction is this: the Metaverse is going to fail.

The stay-at-home culture which VR is fundamentally rooted in doesn’t provide the lived experiences which people want.
