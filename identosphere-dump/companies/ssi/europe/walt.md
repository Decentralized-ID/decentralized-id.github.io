Introducing the SSI Kit, which offers developers and organisations an easy and fast way to use Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI).

* [Hello World. It’s Walt.id](https://walt.id/resources/blog/categories/company/hello-world-its-walt-id)

It is our goal to make SSI simple and accessible: to enable every developer and organisation to build identity and trust into the web and their applications. Ultimately, this will transform every digital interaction into an effortless and worry-free experience.

  > The SSI Kit bundles three components, one for each functionality profile:
  > 
  > - Signatory ™ for Issuers enables organisations to transform any identity-related information into digital credentials in order to replace paper documents and automate data provision to stakeholders.
  > - Custodian ™ for Holders enables individuals and organisations to securely store, manage and share keys and identity data via data hubs (“wallets”). (Web-Based wallet)
  > - Auditor ™ for Verifiers enables organisations to verify identity data in order to authenticate or identify stakeholders and offer frictionless access to services or products.

  > This post introduces our new open source product: the Wallet, which enables developers and organisations to put Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) into the hands and pockets of the people via easy-to-use applications.

  > The Open Policy Agent ([https://www.openpolicyagent.org](https://www.openpolicyagent.org)) is an open source, general-purpose policy engine that unifies policy enforcement. OPA provides a high-level declarative language called [Rego](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/%23rego) that lets you specify policy as code in order to offload policy decision-making from your business logic.

* [Introduction to NFTs for Identity](https://walt.id/decentralized-identity-explained/nfts) walt.id

NFT use cases can be found wherever there’s a need to digitally model ownership. In other words, the list of use cases is long and NFTs will likely be among the most important building blocks on which the digital world (or something like a metaverse) will be built.-
* [The future of Decentralized Identity: SSI vs NFTs](https://walt.id/decentralized-identity-explained/ssi-vs-nfts) Walt ID

While SSI has been developed to model digital identity, NFTs are used to model digital ownership. As a result, the concepts and technologies on which each approach is based differ with far reaching consequences. For example, while NFTs require blockchains, SSI can be used with or without them which is particularly important in the context of compliance and privacy.
