* [How to Handle JWTs in Python](https://auth0.com/blog/how-to-handle-jwt-in-python/)
  > JSON Web Tokens, or JWTs for short, are all over the web. They can be used to track bits of information about a user in a very compact way and can be used in APIs for authorization purposes. This post will cover what JSON Web Tokens are and how to create JWTs in Python using the most popular JWT library: [PyJWT](http://pyjwt.readthedocs.io/). We are also going to see how you can sign and verify JWTs in Python using asymmetric algorithms.

* [Podcast] [Privacy-preserving measures and SD-JWT with Daniel Fett](https://identityunlocked.auth0.com/public/49/Identity%252C-Unlocked.--bed7fada/3bbcbab8) IdentityUnlocked Auth0

The discussion gets very concrete when Daniel describes selective disclosure JWT, or SD-JWT, a new IETF specification he is coauthoring that offers a simple and easy-to-adopt approach to produce JWTs capable of supporting selective disclosure. Here at Identity, Unlocked, we are huge fans of this new specification, and we hope this episode will help you get started!
