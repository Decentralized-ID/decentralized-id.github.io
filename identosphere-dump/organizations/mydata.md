* [Applying for, and being, a MyData Operator](https://www.informationanswers.com/2021/02/03/applying-for-and-being-a-mydata-operator/)

Ian Henderson talks about leading the application process for two MyData Operators [Tru.net](https://www.tru.net/) and [DataYogi](https://datayogi.me/) .

> The core of the awards process is an online questionnaire that each photo-operator completes which provides background on the applying organisation, and then allows them to describe their business in terms of the shared MyData Operator Reference model shown below. This reference model, described in detail in the MyData Operators white paper, is not prescriptive; it is more a useful way to ensure each applying operator frames their responses so that they become easier to understand and assess.

The Me2B Respectful Tech Specification is a sorely needed ethical and safety standard for the internet. It consists of a series of tests that objectively measure the behavior of a connected product or service. The Specification helps people (“Me-s”) understand how technology is treating them, and helps businesses (“B-s”) build technology that is safe and respectful for the people that use it.

As highlighted by the ongoing Facebook Files scandal, transparency and accountability in personal data are increasingly acknowledged as critical for safety online.  To show their commitment to ethical personal data management, participating organisations are required to disclose information about their operations. The MyData Operator Award shows that ethical alternatives exist and provide value for companies and users alike.
