## Oasis
* [Managed Open Projects: A New Way For Open Source and Open Standards To Collaborate](https://www.oasis-open.org/2021/09/08/managed-open-projects/)

I recently pointed out in a [TechCrunch contribution](https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/09/a-revival-at-the-intersection-of-open-source-and-open-standards/) that the open source and open standards communities need to find ways to team up if they are to continue driving innovation and  development of transformative technologies to push our society forward.
### KMIP

* [OASIS releases KMIP 2.1](https://www.oasis-open.org/2020/12/18/key-management-interoperability-protocol-specification-and-key-management-interoperability-protocol-profiles-oasis-standards-published/)
  > The Key Management Interoperability Protocol (KMIP) is a single, comprehensive protocol for communication between clients that request any of a wide range of encryption keys and servers that store and manage those keys. By replacing redundant, incompatible key management protocols, KMIP provides better data security while at the same time reducing expenditures on multiple products.
