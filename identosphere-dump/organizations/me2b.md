* [A Responsible Reporting Nightmare: Right-clicking is Not a Crime](https://me2ba.org/a-responsible-reporting-nightmare-right-clicking-is-not-a-crime/) Me2Ba

This is a story of a politician who cried “hacker” after a reporter informed a state agency that sensitive information was embedded in their website’s HTML source code1. While we wish this was a joke or fictional story it, unfortunately, is not. If the state of Missouri does move forward with the prosecution this state action would sound the alarm for researchers and reporters resulting in a chilling effect on the practice of responsible reporting.

* [First Official Me2B Alliance Recommendation](https://me2ba.org/first-official-me2b-alliance-recommendation/)
  > In a sense, this recommendation is a kind of abbreviation of the key things that our specifications test for. And you’ll be able to see that soon as the Me2B Safe Website Specification for Respectful Technology is currently in the membership review stage of the approval process.

* [Introducing the Me2B 101 Flash Guide Series](https://me2ba.org/introducing-the-me2b-101-flash-guide-series/) Me2B Alliance

When we started drafting the Respectful Tech Specification a couple of years ago, it was immediately obvious that we didn’t have an adequate vocabulary to describe personal experiences in the digital world—never mind measure them.

The Me2B Deals or transactions that occur online typically involve three types of “currency”: money, attention or data. [...] What sets online data monetization apart from the other two currencies is that often, customers have no idea what they are paying with – or that they are paying at all.

* [Flash Guide #6: Online Me2B Relationships](https://me2ba.org/flash-guide-6-online-me2b-relationships/)

our relationship with connected technology includes a set of “hidden affiliates” (third party integrations) that most of us are not aware of. This guide describes how these relationships – conscious or not – emerge as we interact with digital technologies.

* [Flash Guide #7: The Me2B Lifecycle: Overlaying Social Norms on the Digital World](https://me2ba.org/flash-guide-7-the-me2b-lifecycle-overlaying-social-norms-on-the-digital-world/)

This real life social context is currently missing in both existing privacy regulation and in industry standards models for ethical technology [...] Our model helps course-correct connected technology by pinpointing how the digital Me2B experience deviates from important social behavioral norms.

* [Flash Guide #8: Digital Me2B Commitments & Deals](https://me2ba.org/flash-guide-8-digital-me2b-commitments-deals/)

* [Flash Guide #10: Data Flow & the Invisible Parallel Dataverse](https://me2ba.org/flash-guide-10-data-flow-the-invisible-parallel-dataverse/)

Our personal data flows do not start light and increase with time and trust. Instead, a firehose of personal information is released – and shared with a host of unseen third parties – as soon as we open an app or website. Me2BA’s Respectful Tech Specification V.1 is largely focused on testing for these invisible parallel dataverse data flows.

* [12 ways a human-centric approach to data can improve the world](https://me2ba.org/world-economic-forum-12-ways-a-human-centric-approach-to-data-can-improve-the-world/) Me2B Alliance

Twenty-five quintillion bytes of data are generated every day. That’s 25,000,000,000,000,000,000. In this era of data abundance, it’s easy to think of these bytes as a panacea – informing policies and spurring activities to address the pandemic, climate change or gender inequality – but without the right systems in place, we cannot realize the full potential of data to advance a sustainable, equit

  > We think that focusing on Facebook’s surveillance advertising is a good step in the right direction. However, there are several other significant threats to kids out there. In particular, Google’s YouTube [is used by 69% of kids in the United States today, who reportedly spend approximately 1.5 hours a day on the app](https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/04/kids-now-spend-nearly-as-much-time-watching-tiktok-as-youtube-in-u-s-u-k-and-spain/)
