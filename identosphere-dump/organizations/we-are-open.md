The complexity surrounding any global audience can’t be understated, really. I mean, we’re talking about millions of people. GPI communications have to take into account that many are coming to Greenpeace for the first time, while others know the organization well. The audience is diverse. From young to old, every color and creed, a massive spectrum of people who are interested in the mission to “ensure the ability of the earth to nurture life in all its diversity.”

  > In the [W3C VC-EDU](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vc-ed/) call on June 7, 2021 we discussed [Open Badges](https://openbadges.org/) asserted as [W3C Verifiable Credentials](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/) (VCs). This call began the public discussion of Open Badges as Native VCs (potentially as Open Badges 3.0) to inform the IMS Open Badges Working Group. Why are we discussing this? Why does it matter? How will it work?

  > In May, we did some [workshopping with the crypto platform NEAR](https://weareopen.coop/near/), which was the first time we accepted cryptocurrency as part of our fee. In May, We Are Open Cooperative also [turned 5 years old](https://blog.weareopen.coop/wao-turns-five-30747f4df0f9). We celebrated this momentous occasion by launching our [new website](https://weareopen.coop/) and adding more stuff to our [free learning resource hub](https://learnwith.weareopen.coop/).

Yesterday, [the draft](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vc-ed-use-cases/) Verifiable Credentials for Education, Employment, and Achievement Use Cases report was published [...] The next version of the Open Badges specification (v3.0) will be compatible with Verifiable Credentials (VCs).

Open Recognition is the awareness and appreciation of talents, skills and aspirations in ways that go beyond credentialing. This includes recognising the rights of individuals, communities, and territories to apply their own labels and definitions. Their frameworks may be emergent and/or implicit.” ([What is Open Recognition, anyway?](https://blog.weareopen.coop/what-is-open-recognition-anyway-9f38ec1f8629)

Sociocracy is a system of governance that seeks to create psychologically safe environments and productive organizations. It draws on the use of consent, rather than majority voting, in discussion and decision-making by people who have a shared goal or work process.

  > Some organisations were experimenting with digital badges before 2011, but these were siloed and easy to right-click and copy. The ‘technology trigger’, the innovation with Open Badges, was to invent and make available an open metadata standard.

  > This information means that this particular badge, which is manually issued, can be given out in fair and equitable ways. It also means that someone else who engaged with the Open Badges community before 2017 could lay claim to it.
  > 
  > Stealth badges at scale require an automated system that issues badges depending on particular criteria. This is why they are very common in games-based environments. For example, I unlock some most weeks playing new and existing games on my PlayStation and Google Stadia.

* [This model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcyHKKc2LVg) […] shows how systems have a lifespan and what happens as that lifespan peaks.

As one system begins to deteriorate, a new system begins to emerge. This got us thinking about how this model applies to the world of [Open Recognition](https://blog.weareopen.coop/what-is-open-recognition-anyway-9f38ec1f8629).

we want to explain what we talk about when we talk about Open Recognition. It builds on this [previous post](https://blog.weareopen.coop/what-is-open-recognition-anyway-9f38ec1f8629), and aims to move from the abstract to practicalities.

KBW helps people understand the badge landscape. The community is there to provide solidarity for badge champions and newbies. We do not assume prior knowledge of Open Badges or Verifiable Credentials. We recognise and celebrate those who can share their experience. Anyone interested in badges or integrating [Open Recognition](https://blog.weareopen.coop/what-is-open-recognition-anyway-9f38ec1f8629) are welcome to join.

  > We have a new suite of badges to encourage participation, create value for others, and reflect on that experience. Participants will be able to both earn AND award badges, so they’ll have a chance to prove that they’ve understood the theory surrounding CoPs and badges as well as put those theories into practice.

* [How badges can change the world: Part 2: Why we need to transition](https://blog.weareopen.coop/how-badges-can-change-the-world-65395581f90c)

In [Part 1: The Two Loops Model for Open Recognition advocacy](https://blog.weareopen.coop/how-badges-can-change-the-world-73529560caa3), we talked about how as one system begins to deteriorate, an alternative begins to emerge. We know the alternative system, one that integrates credentials with other forms of recognition, is better for everyone. Without that integration, cold-hard credentialing supports outdated power dynamics.
