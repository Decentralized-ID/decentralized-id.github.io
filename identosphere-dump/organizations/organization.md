# Organization

* [Non-binary Thinking will Accelerate Digital Sovereignty (with Rouven Heck)](https://northernblock.io/non-binary-thinking-will-accelerate-digital-sovereignty-with-rouven-heck/) NorthernBlock
  > Now, if we take two communities within the SSI space – the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF) and the Trust over IP Foundation (ToIP). I will sometimes hear people talking positively about one and negatively about the other. But why is this happening? Don’t we all have the same underlying values? Aren’t we all looking to better our lives through digital sovereignty?
  > 
  > I think the answer to this is clear and we need to get away from thinking in a binary manner about anything in our space. And if you really look at the overlap between both these communities: they are quite large.
* [Testing the fitness of your organisation's preparedness for data](https://www.mydigitalfootprint.com/2021/08/testing-fitness-of-your-organisations.html) MyDigitalFootprint
  > How do you determine if your new company is addressing the underlying issues that hold back data from being what they imagine it can be?

  > The panel will review the concepts of federated identities, authentication, and the role attributes play in managing access to services. They’ll further describe how the InCommon Federation and eduGAIN enable academic collaboration across local, regional, national, and international scales, discuss technical alternatives for participation in InCommon, and delve a bit into how research communities and research cyberinfrastructures manage federated access to their services.

conversations about digital identity innovation were mostly treated as a developing country issue, with ardent advocates in the West unwilling to acknowledge that digital identity could add value to developed economies. Now, as the world [emerges from the pandemic](https://omidyar.com/a-decade-of-digital-public-goods-holding-up-the-digital-economy-preventing-monopolies-and-safeguarding-freedoms-for-all/), attitudes seem to have taken a 180-degree turn.

The Dizme ecosystem is expected to include various [technological components leveraging Hyperledger stack](https://www.dizme.io/developers) and adding a monetization layer based on [Algorand blockchain protocol](https://www.algorand.com/resources/news/linux-foundation-announces-dizmeid-foundation-to-enable-self-soverieign-identity-network), which will enable the exchange of verifiable credentials and the development of new vertical applications.

## Gain

* [Panel | Bringing the Global Assured Identity Network (GAIN) to Reality](https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2021-panel-gain-to-reality)

These may seem off-topic but Bill Wendell has been engaged with the VRM and IIW community for well over a decade - He has some great ideas on how to reform/transform the real-estate industry with ideas/models our community has been discussing. If you are looking for an opportunity to collaborate and build something transformative I would reach out to him.

Individuals can access with the peace of mind that all relying parties within the ecosystem are present and accountable. Sure, there will still be malicious vendors, but the scope will be more limited. The ecosystem will be much more secure than the current Internet. It will be enough for the participants to take action. Trust is reestablished.
