# Awesome Decentralized Identity
**DID, Blockchain and Self-Sovereign Identity Resources**

Thanks to those who are working to make our identity experience, and the world, a better place.

[Collaboration Welcome](https://github.com/infominer33/awesome-decentralized-id/blob/master/contributing.md)

#### Foreword
Information is not so easily organized in a linear fashion. This list is a by-product of the effort to enter all of the best blockchain, self-sovereign, and decentralized identity links into a database that will power a [web-app](https://github.com/infominer33/Crypto-library) for search, navigation by tags, and pages like this with pre-arranged information. The SuperSource will have comments, submissions, ratings and reactions; so that it can become a co-operative effort among those who get involved.

In the mean-time, after gathering all of the links I had already into [one collection](/blockchain-id.toml), I knew I could make an awesome list out of them sooner than a live demo of the app that is in progress.

Furthermore, I'm now working on [/awesome-sovrin](https://github.com/infominer33/awesome-decentralized-id/tree/master/awesome-sovrin/README.md) as a place to focus more on the Sovrin\Indy protocol and ecosystem. Ideally, I hope for these 'Awesome' lists to compliment each-other along with [/peacekeeper/blockchain-identity](https://github.com/peacekeeper/blockchain-identity/). It will take a bit of thinking, and perhaps some collaboration to decide the best way to do that.

>Imagine a world where you are in direct control of your personal information; a world where you can limit and control how much information you share while retaining the ability to transact in the world. This is self-sovereign identity, and it is already here. Blockchain is the underlying technology paving the path to self-sovereign identity through decentralized networks. It ensures privacy and trust, where transactions are secure, authenticated and verifiable and endorsed by relevant, permissioned participants.

### Internet Identity Workshop[**^**](#Contents)

In 2005, [Kaliya Young](https://identitywoman.net/)[[**twitter**](https://twitter.com/IdentityWoman)], [Phil Windley](https://windley.com)[[**twitter**](https://twitter.com/windley)], [Drummond Reed](https://www.evernym.com/)[[**twitter**](https://twitter.com/drummondreed)][[**blog**](https://equalsdrummond.name/)], and [Doc Searls](http://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/)[[**twitter**](https://twitter.com/dsearls)][[**blog**](https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc)] hosted the first [Internet Identity Workshop](http://www.internetidentityworkshop.com/)(IIW)[[**twitter**](https://twitter.com/idworkshop)] in Berkeley to discuss "architectural and governance proposals for Internet-wide identity services and their underlying philosophies." -[Announcing IIW 2005](https://identitywoman.net/announcing-the-internet-identity-workshop-iiw2005/)

Since then, the IIW has met bi-anually, actively supporting the development of the identity software-ecosystem, including [OpenID](http://wiki.openid.net)('05), OpenID [2.0](http://wiki.openid.net/w/page/12995215/OpenID%20Authentication%202-1)('06), [OAuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth)('10), [FIDO](https://fidoalliance.org/)('13) and OpenID [Connect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenID_Connect)('14). The heart of the internet identity community has been with empowering users and self-sovereign principles, since the early days.

* [*What is Sovereign Source Authority?*](https://www.moxytongue.com/2012/02/what-is-sovereign-source-authority.html) shows an early use of 'sovereign' in relation to our internet identities. The term "Self Sovereign Identity" started becoming widely used in 2014.[[**1**](https://www.tokencommons.org/Windhover-Principles-for-Digital-Identity-Trust-Data.html)][[**2**](https://hubculture.com/hubs/47/news/689/)] 
* [Not Just Who They Say We Are: Claiming our identity on the Internet](https://vimeo.com/207961532)- short film on the “Identerati” at IIW[[**4**](https://www.prweb.com/releases/identitymovie/iiw2017/prweb14161721.htm)]
   * Identirati is a term for those working in the identity ecosystem dating back to at least 2006:
      >[identirati](https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-identity-silo-paradox/)[[**5**](https://www.forgerock.com/blog/who-are-the-identerati)] "have been working on standards and methods that are based on the premise of opening up those [id data] silos"

### Bitnation and the United Nations[**^**](#Contents) 

9\15 [Bitnation](https://bitnation.co/) "seeks to establish the concept of '*world citizenship*' via a bitcoin based identity, offering '[*blockchain emergency IDs*](https://refugees.bitnation.co/)' to refugees.[[**8**](https://www.newsbtc.com/2015/09/09/bitnation-taps-blockchain-tech-to-aid-refugees/)] The same month, the UN unveiled it's *Agenda for Sustainable Development*.

* [Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development](https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/post2015/transformingourworld).
> **Goal 16.9 By 2030, provide legal identity for all, including birth registration.**
* [DIGITAL IDENTITY AS A BASIC HUMAN RIGHT](https://impakter.com/digital-identity-basic-human-right/)
* [AID:Tech](https://aid.technology)[[**twitter**]](https://twitter.com/aidtechnology) — "is a voucher and digital identity solution for refugees. A digital record of a person's identity is stored on a smart card, along with various additional information. Blockchain technology is used to distribute all resources in a highly traceable manner."

### Rebooting the Web Of Trust[**^**](#Contents)

In relation to SSI, '[Web of Trust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_of_trust)' is a network of relationships that attest to our identity claims. *Each party attesting to your identity information becomes a strand in your web of trust.*

The first [Rebooting Web of Trust](http://www.WebOfTrust.info)(RWoT)  workshop was held during [November 2015](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rebooting-the-web-of-trust); attracting the likes of Vitalik Buterin, Peter Todd, Gregory Maxwell, Joel Dietz, Christopher Allen, and Jon Callas, [according to Andreas Antonopolis](https://news.bitcoin.com/andreas-antonopoulos-case-reputation-identity-systems/). 
[The initial workshop](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/), produced 5 technical white papers: \
[[5 WoT-usecases](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rebooting-the-web-of-trust/blob/master/final-documents/satisfying-real-world-use-cases.pdf)][[Decentralized PKI](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rebooting-the-web-of-trust/blob/master/final-documents/dpki.pdf)][[Smart Signatures](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rebooting-the-web-of-trust/blob/master/final-documents/smart-signatures.pdf)][[Creating a New World of Trust](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rebooting-the-web-of-trust/blob/master/final-documents/whats-the-next-step.pdf)][[Rebranding the Web of Trust](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rebooting-the-web-of-trust/blob/master/final-documents/rebranding-web-of-trust.pdf)]:

>The Web of Trust is a buzzword for a new model of decentralized self-sovereign identity. It’s a phrase that dates back almost twenty-five years, the classic definition derives from PGP [...] the vibrant blockchain community is also drawing new attention to the concept we aim to reboot it.

### ID2020 and the GDPR[**^**](#Contents)

![](http://imgur.com/ymviAssl.png)

* [Christopher Allen](http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/)[[**twitter**](https://twitter.com/ChristopherA)][[**github**](https://github.com/ChristopherA)] details the overarching history of internet idenitity standards in his seminal work: 
   - **[The Path to Self-Soverereign Identity](http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2016/04/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity.html)**[[**3**](https://www.coindesk.com/path-self-sovereign-identity/amp/)].

[4/16](https://edps.europa.eu/data-protection/data-protection/legislation/history-general-data-protection-regulation_en) the EU adopted the GDPR, enacted as law May 2018. The second RWoT workshop ran in conjunction with the UN's [ID2020](https://id2020.org/) Summit in New York that [May](https://press.pwc.com/News-releases/id2020-to-kick-start-digital-identity-summit-at-un-with-pwc-support./s/9fe11be5-cbd8-486b-b4d2-d798f486d0f2). There are an estimated 1.5 billion without a legal identity.[[**9**](https://id2020.org/news/2016/12/2/identity-20)] Without a legal identity it is very difficult to recieve any services, aide, or to advance ones station in life. 

Evident from the whitepapers produced at the RWoT\ID2020 Workshop[[**10**](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/ID2020DesignWorkshop/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/README.md)] the DID identifier began to emerge:

[[Clearer Identity Through Correlation](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/ID2020DesignWorkshop/blob/master/final-documents/identity-crisis.pdf)][[Physician Patient Relationship](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/ID2020DesignWorkshop/blob/master/final-documents/physician-patient-relationship.pdf)][[Protecting Digital ID in Developing Countries](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/ID2020DesignWorkshop/blob/master/final-documents/protecting-digital-identities-in-developing-countries.pdf)][[Smarter Signatures](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/ID2020DesignWorkshop/blob/master/final-documents/smarter-signatures.pdf)]
   >"Respect Network is conducting a research project for the [U.S. Department of Homeland Security](https://bravenewcoin.com/insights/u-s-department-of-homeland-security-funds-four-blockchain-companies-developing-new-cyber-security-technology), HSHQDC-16-C-00061, to analyze the applicability of blockchain technologies to a decentralized identifier system. Our thesis is that blockchains, or more generically distributed ledgers, are a potentially powerful new tool for “identity roots” — the starting points for an Internet identity. However “blockchain identity” may not fully address the core security and privacy principles needed in a complete identity system. In this case DIDs — Decentralized Identifiers rooted on a distributed ledger — may end up being a foundational building block for higher level identity management solutions. -[Requirements for DIDs](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/ID2020DesignWorkshop/blob/master/final-documents/requirements-for-dids.pdf)

* At this point in time DLT innovation, the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, and the EU GDPR all came together supporting a core identirati tenant: Eliminating id data silos and empowering users regarding personal digital identity. 

### Decentralized Identity Foundation[**^**](#Contents) 

On May 22 at Consensus 2017 the formation of the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF) [was announced](https://www.ethnews.com/decentralized-identity-foundation-announces-formation-at-consensus-2017):

>Identity Mixer is not directly (re)implemented by Sovrin, but its cryptographic foundations are very similar, and Sovrin’s implementation includes most of its extended features (predicates, multi-credential, revocation, advanced issuance…). One of the researchers who helped to create Identity Mixer is on Sovrin’s Technical Governance Board and has offered insight to keep the implementations aligned on goals and methods.
