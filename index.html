<p><blockquote>A good self‐sovereign identity system will allow individuals to directly influence how companies, governments, and others correlate our interactions across different services and locations by default. It won’t fix all identity problems nor preclude alternative identity approaches, but it will put the individual in control of most uses of identity and give organizations a simpler, easier, more ethical way to use identity to improve how they provide services and products. When successful, it will not only enable individuals to exercise greater control over how companies and governments keep track of us, it will also illuminate those situations where self‐sovereign identity is restricted, facilitating a conversation about when and where such limits are appropriate. <br><a href="https://github.com/jandrieu/rebooting-the-web-of-trust-fall2016/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/a-technology-free-definition-of-self-sovereign-identity.pdf">Joe Andrieu -A Technology‐Free Definition of Self‐Sovereign Identity</a></blockquote></p>

<h2>Decentralized-ID.com Updates!</h2>

<p>At the end of 2022, we won an Explorer Award from <a href="https://filecoin.io/">Filecoin</a> and <a href="https://unfinished.com/">Unfinished</a>.</p>

<p><blockquote>Congratulations! We are happy to notify you that your proposal has been selected as an awardee of the Filecoin Foundation and <a href="https://filecoinfoundation.medium.com/announcing-explorer-awards-by-filecoin-foundation-and-unfinished-70c9d569f418">Unfinished Explorer Awards</a> in the amount of $10,000 USD! Your application was one of a small number that we have selected out of almost 100 applications, and our team was incredibly impressed with your proposal.</blockquote></p>

<p>We used those resources to pull in 2 years worth of curated links from the <a href="https://newsletter.identosphere.net">Identosphere BlogCatcher</a> to this web-directory.</p> 

<p>Over the course of 2023, we added <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/posts/">68 new pages</a> to this site, while also refactoring the entire collection, including considerable <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/recent/"></a>updates to 47 existing pages</a>. Those updates include cleaning up dead links, re-organizing, and removing any depreciated content.</p>

<p>You may also notice that some of the pages are formatted slightly different than others. That's because we have begun a transition to storing all content as structured data. Instead of duplicating various resources manually across the site, we can now include the same resource on multiple pages, depending upon its metadata. This new structure will also enable us to automate site maintnence and upkeep.</p>

<p><strong>Thanks to Filecoin and Unfinished for supporting us in the effort to make the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/ecosystem/">Decentralized Identity Ecosystem</a> more easy to navigate.</strong></p>
