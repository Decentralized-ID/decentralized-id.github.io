Eventually there will be a section with individual pages for the various influential and\or prominent members of the DID\SSI community. But I wasn't sure where to start...

It turns out that many of the Domains of Identity include registries. This whole perspective that registries as the root of many of our systems is very eye opening. Just like when one finds identity one sees it everywhere, it turns our registries are everywhere too.
