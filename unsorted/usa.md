Please read Section 3 in the EO

* […]

It may be time for us to explain Zero-Trust Architecture relationship to

VCs and DIDs. My not-so-hidden agenda includes priority for considering

authorization and delegation in our protocol work but our diverse community of security experts will surely make this a much broader discussion.

Sec. 3.  Modernizing Federal Government Cybersecurity.

(a)  To keep pace with today’s dynamic and increasingly sophisticated cyber threat environment, the Federal Government must take decisive steps to modernize its approach to cybersecurity, including by increasing the Federal Government’s visibility into threats, while protecting privacy and civil liberties.  The Federal Government must adopt security best practices; advance toward Zero Trust Architecture; accelerate movement to secure cloud services, including Software as a Service (SaaS), Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), and Platform as a Service (PaaS); centralize and streamline access to cybersecurity data to drive analytics for identifying and managing cybersecurity risks; and invest in both technology and personnel to match these modernization goals.

Many folks within the identity space see VC infrastructure as the future of identification.

California is a major center of new privacy law and regulation, creating opportunities for internet safety advocates to help design policies that will ripple out well beyond the state’s borders. Their Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), passed by ballot proposition in 2020, created the California Privacy Protection Agency (CPPA), which seems to be getting closer to initiating its first formal rulemaking process.
