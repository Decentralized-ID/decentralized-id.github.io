“The earliest mutual organization established in the British North American colonies was created in 1735 in Charleston, SC” [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_cooperatives_in_the_United_States#18th_century](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_cooperatives_in_the_United_States#18th_century)

“The Philadelphia Contributionship mutual insurance company, founded by Benjamin Franklin in 1752, is the oldest continuing mutual insurance company in the continental United States. “

Coop says more about the governance (democracy + open membership) than the business model, IMO

A cooperative is defined as an autonomous association of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly-owned and democratically-controlled enterprise.

  > - First, machine-readable governance simplifies how decentralized identity works: The user software handles the rules for information flows and authentication, which are established and published by the entities with authority for governing the use case.
  > - Second, this architecture makes these rules transparent.
  > - Third, and critically, it enables these rules to function offline through caching, which, when you think about it, is an essential feature in any digital identity verification system; trust can’t be dependent on a Wi-Fi signal.

  > 1. The state of the art in digital identification are trust frameworks that accommodate diverse technologies, systems and stakeholders\n  > 2. Risks remain even within the most rigorous trust framework:\n  > 3. Achieving inclusion requires addressing both technical and political dimensions\n > 4. Trust frameworks are complicated so getting governance right requires an ecosystems approach\n  > 5. Building the future of digital identification means reckoning with an analogue past

* [Trust Frameworks](https://medium.com/mattr-global/learn-concepts-trust-frameworks-ad96a4427991) Mattr Global
  > Trust frameworks are a foundational component of the web of trust. A trust framework is a common set of best practice standards-based rules that ensure minimum requirements are met for security, privacy, identification management and interoperability through accreditation and governance. These operating rules provide a common framework for ecosystem participants, increasing trust between them.

  >  1. Levels of Assurance (LOA): an introduction to LOAs as they relate to Digital Identity and why they’re an important part of the recipe in achieving digital trust. Tim and Darrell give us some practical examples of LOAs.
  > 2. The Concept of Trust: how do we define trust at a high-level and how do we differentiate between technical and human trust? How can we build trust with credential issuers but also with credential holders?
  > 3. The World of Trust Frameworks: what are trust frameworks and what are different types of frameworks being deployed in both the public and private sectors? How are organizations trying to monetize trust frameworks? What’s going right, and what’s going wrong with the way trust frameworks are being implemented?
  > 4. The Importance of Open Source for Trust Creation: why is open source important for achieving digital sovereignty? Is open source the only way to improve transparency, flexibility and accountability?

* [Trust Frameworks? Standards Matter](https://medium.com/@trbouma/trust-frameworks-standards-matter-47c946992f44) Tim Bouma
  > He points at the NIST documents about it [Developing Trust Frameworks to Support Identity Federations](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2018/NIST.IR.8149.pdf) published in 2018. He also points at the Canadian government’s definition of standards.\n“a document that provides a set of agreed-upon rules, guidelines or characteristics for activities or their results. Standards establish accepted practices, technical requirements, and terminologies for diverse fields.”  He goes on to highlight a lot of the work being done in Canada and where it all sits relative to being a standard - “In closing, there are lots of trust frameworks being developed today. But to be truly trusted, a trust framework needs to either apply existing standards or become a standard itself.”

  > Right now, we are alpha testing the framework with different kinds of actors, both public and private, and with assessors. Through this process, we’re going to learn what may need to change, and what may not need to change. We’re going to get real knowledge there. I will say that what we’re seeing already, is that DIACC and our priorities are really driven by members.

* [Trinsic Basics: What Is a Trust Registry?](https://trinsic.id/trinsic-basics-what-is-a-trust-registry/) Trinsic
  > Trust registries also need to be interoperable. The [Trust Over IP Foundation](https://www.trustoverip.org/) has a [specification](https://github.com/trustoverip/tswg-trust-registry-tf) for an interoperable trust registry, and ours is the first implementation of this spec. Because of this, Trinsic’s Trust Registry Service is architected so that one ecosystem could reference or incorporate a trust registry from a separate ecosystem if needed.

## Trust Registries

* [Managing Trust and Reputation via Trust Registries](https://www.continuumloop.com/managing-trust-and-reputation-via-trust-registries/) Continuum Loop

The concept behind a Trust Registry is that a Wallet needs to know which decentralized identifiers (DIDs) to “trust” as a source of truth. At many levels, this “trust” translates to “authority” – knowing that somebody, centralized or decentralized, is responsible for maintaining a list of trusted DIDs.

* [Bottom-up Trust Registry in Self Sovereign Identity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.04624v1) Kai Jun Eer, Jesus Diaz, Markulf Kohlweiss Arxiv
  > we propose a trust registry design that handles the aspect of human trust in self sovereign identity. We also introduce an incentivisation mechanism for the trust registry in order to motivate each stakeholder to participate actively and honestly.
* [A novel approach to establish trust in verifiable credential issuers in Self-sovereign identity ecosystems using TRAIN](https://dl.gi.de/handle/20.500.12116/38702) 2022-07-07 Isaac Johnson Jeyakumar, David Chadwick; Michael Kubach Open Identity Summit
  > This paper illustrates how TRAIN (Trust mAnagement INfrastructure), an approach based on established components like ETSI trust lists and the Domain Name System (DNS), can be used as a trust registry component to provide a holistic approach for trust management in SSI ecosystems. TRAIN facilitates individual trust decisions through the discovery of trust lists in SSI ecosystems, along with published credential schemas, so that verifiers can perform informed trust decisions about issued credentials.
* [Trust Registries in the Real World](https://www.continuumloop.com/trust-registries-in-the-real-world/) Continuum Loop
  > Trust Registries allow us to know that the various shared credentials (e.g. proof of insurance) are accurate. A Homeowner can ask their Digital Wallet to verify an insurance Credential that the Contractor is honest.

  > Decentralized Ecosystem Governance makes verifying data an easy-to-play game of red light/green light. And, importantly, it decentralizes governance to the appropriate authorities.
* [Trust Registry or Machine-Readable Governance?](https://indicio.tech/trust-registry-or-machine-readable-governance/) 2021-09-28 Indicio
  > Machine-readable governance is composed of elements that help to establish trust and enable interoperability: trusted participants, schemas (templates for structuring information in a credential), and rules and flows for presenting credentials and verifying them. Machine-readable governance can be hierarchical. Once a governance system is published, other organizations can adopt and then amend or extend the provided system.
