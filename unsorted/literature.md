* [Self-Sovereign Identity as a Service: Architecture in Practice](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.08314.pdf) Yepeng Ding, Hiroyuki Sato, University of Tokyo
  > We propose a practical architecture by elaborating the service concept, SSI, and DLT to implement SSIaaS platforms and SSI services. Besides, we present an architecture for constructing and customizing SSI services with a set of architectural patterns and provide corresponding evaluations. Furthermore, we demonstrate the feasibility of our proposed architecture in practice with Selfid, an SSIaaS platform based on our proposed architecture.

  > Although this article shall focus on challenges related to identity systems for adult persons in the developed world, we argue that the considerations around data protection and personal data that are applicable in the humanitarian context, such as those elaborated by the International Committee of the Red Cross (Kuner and Marelli, 2017; Stevens et al., 2018), also apply to the general case. We specifically consider the increasingly commonplace application of identity systems “to facilitate targeting, profiling and surveillance” by “binding us to our recorded characteristics and behaviors” (Privacy International, 2019). Although we focus primarily upon the application of systems for digital credentials to citizens of relatively wealthy societies, we hope that our proposed architecture might contribute to the identity zeitgeist in contexts such as humanitarian aid, disaster relief, refugee migration, and the special interests of children as well.

Under our analysis of trust and the digital world, we define differenttypes of trust relationships and find out the factors that are needed to ensure a fully representative model.Next, to meet the challenges of digital trust modelling, comprehensive trust model evaluation criteria areproposed, and potential securities and privacy issues of trust modelling are analyzed. Finally, we provide awide-ranging analysis of different methodologies, mathematical theories, and how they can be applied totrust modelling

  > This report explores the potential of self-sovereign identity (SSI) technologies to ensure secure electronic identification and authentication to access cross-border online services offered by Member States under the eIDAS Regulation. It critically assesses the current literature and reports on the current technological landscape of SSI and existing eID solutions, as well as the standards, communities, and pilot projects that are presently developing in support of these solutions.

### Disposable Yet Official Identities

* [Disposable Yet Official Identities (DYOI)](https://zenodo.org/record/4016977#.X4NIjy2ZMWq) for Privacy-Preserving System Design - The case of COVID-19 digital document verification and credential-based access control in ad hoc outdoor and indoor settings (and beyond)
  > In this paper we report on the design of a service system to endow next-generation COVID-19 mobile applications with the capacity: a) to instantly manage and verify a wide range of possible COVID-19 digital documents (circulation attestations, work or travel permits based on approved COVID-19 tests, vaccination certificates, etc.) and, b) to provide credential-based access control, especially in cases where the Verifier is not a web entity but a human agent with a smartphone, or an IoT device -- mainly in ad hoc outdoor and indoor settings. The system has been designed as a response to the specific needs of a health emergency situation, but it may have a broader application in different cased and areas of control (such as airport and train stations checking points and board controls), where the verification process must exclude the possibility of a physical interaction between the controller and the subject of control, by maintaining a “safe distance” between them and while preserving a certain privacy for the subject of control. Our approach levers the potential of Disposable Identities, Self-Sovereign Identities technologies and Verifiable Credentials (VCs) to enable digital document verification and credential-based access control in ad hoc outdoor and indoor settings (and beyond). Towards this, we specifically introduce the concept of “Derivative” (i.e., transcoded/contextual) Verifiable Credentials. A Derivative VC is a derived bond contract guaranteeing the validity and ownership over the underlying contracts (VCs) whose: a) usability is restricted in a very specific context (that of the “local” and time-limited interaction between a Subject and a Service Provider) and, b) linking table points only to a specific “Pairwise DID”.
