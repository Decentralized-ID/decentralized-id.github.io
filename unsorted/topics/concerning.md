* [#Identity. Are we (the industry) the problem?](https://www.mydigitalfootprint.com/2021/08/identity-are-we-industry-problem.html) MyDigitalFootprint

It is evident that our ongoing discussions about identity, ethics, bias, privacy and consent revolve around a lot of noise (opinions) but little signal (alignment), but why?  Recognising that in 30 years of digital identity, we still lack coherent and coordinated action to make it work for everyone is a reality.
