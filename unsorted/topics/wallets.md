In cross-border and migration contexts, digital wallets promise to have wide ranging implications for global governance, especially in identity management and finance. In this brief Margie Cheesman outlines use cases as well as concerns and risks when it comes to their adoption in the migration sector.

  > The unified theory of acceptance and use of technology was extended to examine the potential influence of the self sovereign identity principles and trustworthyness, along with other factors such as percieved usefulness and perceived ease of use, on the adoption of this new approach to online identity

  > If an identity is tied to a single persistent private key, then loss or compromise of the private key will mean total loss of the identity. Since key compromise and/or loss do happen there needs to be a way to recover from this in order to have a persistent digital identity. [See here for definitions used](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rebooting-the-web-of-trust/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/shared_terminology_for_digital_identity_systems.md).

  > If the user of the identity suspects that a key is or may be compromised the user can rotate their key by submitting a new key to the system, signed by the old key. After this the old key can be revoked.

Looking for your feedback on how we can improve this more[DIF Wallet Security WG - Wallet Implementers Survey](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-credentials/2022Jan/0063.html)  Bastian, Paul (Friday, 7 January)

I summarized our [goals and visions in this presentation](https://nextcloud.idunion.org/s/D2cbMi6w8t3nPYj), for more information check out [the Github page](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/wallet-security)

Also we ended up to initiating 2 new work items at the end of last year:

As most of us know, that eventually led to the realization of the many dimensions of decentralization and creation of the excellent "DID Method Rubric" by JoeA, RyanG, and DanielH (with support from a very large cast of characters in this community).

It feels like we're in the early throes of a "Wallet Rubric".

* [Digital Identity Wallet: A place for your self-sovereign identity](https://ssi-ambassador.medium.com/digital-identity-wallet-a-place-for-your-self-sovereign-identity-5dfbd3d48a74) SSI Ambassador

A digital identity wallet enables a user to establish relationships and interact with third parties in a trusted manner. While the wallet aspect is mainly dealing with key management, storage aspects and the graphical interface (UI = User Interface), the third party interactions are rather organised by your agent, which is a part of your wallet.

* [SSI Wallets](https://www.gimly.io/blog/ssi-wallets)

SSI Wallets are one of the essential components that make self sovereign identity possible. An increasing number of SSI Wallet apps are being released, each with slightly differing feature sets. This post is intended as an evergreen overview and comparison of SSI Wallet apps. If we discover a new one, we'll add it here. If you've developed an SSI Wallet app, feel free to make a pull request to [this repository](https://github.com/Gimly-Blockchain/ssi-wallets) to get added to this list.

The biggest disadvantage of non-custodial wallets is their inaccessibility when you lose or forget the password. Since you are the sole custodian, there is a huge responsibility on you to always remember the password of your wallet.

Digital Wallets are taking off! OS operators such as Apple are starting to support open standards for digital credentials ([here](https://spec.smarthealth.cards/)).

Perceived benefit + Perceived ease of use => Behavioral intention

Her hypotheses: (slide 13)

H1: Perceived usefulness will have a positive effect on behavioral intention to use a self-sovereign identity digital wallet.

H2: Perceived ease of use will have a positive effect on behavioral intention to use a self-sovereign identity digital wallet.

H3: Trustworthiness will have a positive effect on behavioral intention to use a self-sovereign identity digital wallet.

H3a: Trustworthiness will have a positive effect on perceived usefulness.

Second demo video using a different potential flow: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEBNGj377Vc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEBNGj377Vc)

Paper VC’s are hard to bring to parity with “digital VC’s”. The biggest issue is binding subject to holder and verifying that. There were also callouts on how do you prevent replication.

Traditionally, QR codes with the entire VC can be put onto a piece of paper. We proposed compression on those QR codes using CBOR-LD that reduces size of codes by 50%.

Alternative ways include adding VC’s into NFC chips and adding the NFC identifier as a claim to the VC preventing duplication. There is a cost overhead to this compared to paper but is a cost potentially worth occurring.

  > SSI and identity wallets will make it easier for citizens, organizations and governments to manage (digital) identities. It will make registrations and transactions across the internet private and secure. It will also make organizations more efficient and effective. As administration is reduced, costs will decrease.

In the offline world, we typically store credentials in a physical wallet — it keeps them all in one place, protects them by keeping them close to our body, and makes them easy to carry around and access when we need them. The job of a digital wallet is no different:

1. Store your credentials, keys/keycards, bills/receipts, etc
2. Protect them from theft or prying eyes.
3. Keep them handy — easily available and portable across all your devices.
