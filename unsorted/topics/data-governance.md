### Dynamic Data Economy: Digital Identity, Authentic Data Flows, Data Mesh and other dragons by Robert Mitwicki

DDE, HCF, Data Mesh, KERI, OCA

Session was held by Human Colossus Foundation folks who described the vision for DDE which is developed within the Colossi network around the foundations.

Dynamic Data Economy is a roadmap towards fair, decentralized and authentic data economy. Many times people are referring to blockchain technology as a revolution within digital space. But often they actually mean something more profound: the promise of Decentralisation brought by blockchain. A Dynamic Data Economy brings decentralization outside the technology realm into digital solutions for any economic actors. It does so by decentralizing all layers of the ecosystem:

- Decentralized Governance - no administrative entity fully controls and sets the rules, Individuals, organization and government are sovereign on their data Governance.
- Decentralized Architecture - physically decentralization of resources running that network. Economic actors keep control of their data storage solution according to the level of security required.
- Decentralized Logic (Data) - if you cut the system in half it can continue working and data is not damaged in any way, e.g. no need for total ordering.

No blockchain fulfills all those requirements and some none at all. And this is a problem for sensitive areas (e.g. identity or data portability) Then the agreements on sets of principles, protocols and rules to fulfill those requirements are “add-ons”.They are not in the system by design and thus weakens the overall solution Thus the Human Colossus Foundation (HCF) is seeking for opening up discussion and lead towards standardization efforts to ensure that the decentralized technologies already existing brings to life a Dynamic Data Economy for all with and without blockchain.

* [An introduction to The Authentic Data Economy](https://iiw.idcommons.net/4E/_An_introduction_to_The_Authentic_Data_Economy) by David Huseby

This was a session to discuss the topics I brought up in my article on the authentic data economy:

* [The Authentic Data Economy. Universal Digital Trust at Global Scale | by 𝔡𝔴𝔥 - Medium](https://dwhuseby.medium.com/the-authentic-data-economy-9802da67e1fa)

With each successive wave of computerization the new innovations built on the last. Each one taking more of human-scale processes and shrinking them down and putting them into computers and eventually online. The authentic data economy isn’t any different. It leverages data collection and networking and personal computing advances. It makes our data ours and authentic. It builds on all of the previous work done by countless engineers and inventors and dreamers. However, by being the last big problem it represents the final piece that brings together everything that came before it. The scope of the authentic data economy is literally everything in the human sphere. There is nothing that this won’t change. Trust will go everywhere and into everything. But most importantly, so will privacy.

I talked about how the break from the W3C DID specs and other key innovations in cryptography have enabled me and Mike Lodder to design a solution for identity and all data provenance that is 1. privacy preserving, 2. scalable to global scale and how that creates an opportunity for authentic data to become the primary way data is used in the world.

The goal of this session is to present the idea and get community feedback regarding this.

Credential Marketplace is quite high up the SSI stack but we want to start this discussion.

1. What is Credential Marketplace?
2. We have a Trust Triangle of Issuer-Holder-Verifier. This does not need any centralized entity except schema hosting.
3. However, we want to solve the problem of discovery of Issuers and Verifiers.
4. Example: I’m traveling to a new country. I need to get what healthcare VCs are needed to go there, in an automated way.
5. How can we solve this without relaying on a centralized registry of Verifier requirements and Issuer capabilities?
6. How it works
7. In order to discover issuers / vc types, there should be a registration step where issuers/verifiers actively OR passively provide metadata about their capabilities.
8. Credential Data — can contain some filters or constraints on the data from within the VC. E.g. As a Verifier, I only accept passport VC from only certain governments: only German nationals.
9. VC Metadata
10. Issuer Metadata
11. Reputation mechanism for credential issuers
12. Marketplace can also implement value transfer: paying for issuance by the verifier, for example. Even if they are part of different SSI ecosystems. This is optional but can help incentivize different participants.

* [International Semantic Infrastructure: Requirements for a distributed data economy](https://iiw.idcommons.net/21L/_International_Semantic_Infrastructure:_Requirements_for_a_distributed_data_economy) by Paul Knowles

Brent Shambaugh. Integrate computing, processing, storage. Virtual machine to integrate databases. Query language, like Linked Data, over a lot of different systems. SeeQL(?) - translate. Categorical databases (Ryan and David’s work): to not really rely on a single source ofo truth, but more rely on transformations between things. Use category theory to have an exact/provable way of doing that. Cat theory has to follow certain rules. Cat theory kind of abstract but provides a framework for unrelated disparate things. Ryan could say how to algebraicly describe things, which would branch off into… Josh at Uber: come up with schemas, get down to the data/logical layer. Different places to go. Way to translate in from out. Might have multiple different ones, want to map from each one, but if you have a vague interpediary in centralized model, loosely defined that both map to, then have a mapping between the two things. Linked Data problem

* [...]

Linking data together is about machine readability. Involved humans… need to understand. Do it through language. Humans like OCA because can understand data in different languages, makes sense for people. Human element. In that capture space. Want to refine OCA, take out some of the rules parts, masking overlay, conditional overlays, and get it away from OCA as architecture - it convolutes things. OCA only meant for making theings human-readable.
