## Myth

* [Myths about SSI](https://jolocom.io/blog/myths-about-ssi/) Jolocom
  > The idea that as a user of SSI I have complete sovereignty over my digital identity is often misunderstood. At its core, SSI is about my digital identity being under my own control, so I can decide to whom I show my data, when, and for what.

## Big Picture

* [Crossfunctionality](https://docs.centre.io/blog/crossfunctionationality) 2022-08-13 Centre
  > I have developed a pet peeve for "technosolutionism": the notion that a sufficiently innovative technology can solve a social problem, or a business problem, without complex and nuanced changes to social and business practice.
* [Unwrapping the Decentralised Identity Landscape](https://www.affinidi.com/post/unwrapping-the-decentralised-identity-landscape) 2022-07-08 Affinidi
  > Decentralised identity, an emerging trust framework for digital identity, strives to give data ownership and control back to the user. This framework empowers individuals to own his or her data, decide where to store it, and choose to share some or all of it with others. Often, this decentralised identity is used to create verifiable and shareable data for securely accessing products and services.

  > As noted above, the ergonomics of having to make an account on every new system are fairly bad: it requires the user to have a large number of passwords, which is more opportunities to use a bad password or to lose your password and have to recover. There are some opportunities for improvement around the margin (e.g., WebAuthn instead of passwords for authentication), better form fill-in so users don't have to type their name over and over, etc, but at the end of the day, there's only so much you can do.
