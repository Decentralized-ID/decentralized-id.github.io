  > The important thing in SSI is that instead of a stamp on the plastic card, the credential is signed cryptographically by the issuer, enabling anyone to verify who issued the credentials. This makes verification much easier than in the physical world.

  > Back to the Schelling Point - communication requires a common language and understanding. As governments, banks, hospitals, etc. navigate how best to homogenize authenticating user identities in multiple contexts, solutions will depend on user adoption. Maximizing adoption requires avoiding a Schelling point by creating a shared, accessible, and evolving Decentralized Identity Lexicon.

Trust, as always in security, is essential to this new class of relationships and must be established and then protected from abuse. Ease of use, it turns out, is a key factor in protecting that trust and promoting the adoption of good identity patterns. I’m sure that I could have learned these lessons in some other way, but I’ll never forget my half year answering to a pseudonym.

  > This paper analyses the SSI paradigm's conceptual characteristics and technical aspects and presents three use cases as examples. It becomes clear that SSI offers advantages in individual control, data security, and full portability of identities between different services. For example, forgeryand tamper-proof digital versions of important personal documents such as ID cards, passports, birth certificates or medical confirmations can be created. However, the use cases are not limited to personal SSI but can also be, for example, digital identities of organizations and physical objects in the context of IoT solutions. This is particularly important in connection with the comprehensive digitization of companies.
* [What is the Trust Triangle?](https://academy.affinidi.com/what-is-the-trust-triangle-9a9caf36b321) Affinidi
  > The relationship between the issuers, holders, and verifiers is called the trust triangle simply because you need an element of trust among these entities for them to work together.
* [WhitePaper] [Self Sovereign Identity](https://www.blockchainresearchinstitute.org/project/self-sovereign-identity) Phil Windley, Blockchain Research Institute
  > the relationship view of identity, the nature of authentic digital relationships, the trust bases of identity systems, and the architecture of the identity metasystem, including decentralized identifier communication and the self-sovereign Internet. He then explores how to operationalize digital relationships and the potential of generative identities (e.g., verifiable credentials) and credential exchange. He concludes with a deep dive into self-sovereign identities in production: the UK National Health Service staff passport, Bonifii’s MemberPass for credit unions, the International Air Transport Association Travel Pass, and others.

* [The Era of Self-Sovereign Identity](https://www.chakray.com/era-self-sovereign-identity/) ChakRay
  > Similar actions conducted in person do not represent the same amount of risk. For example, if someone asks you to verify your identity, we show our ID or driver’s license, and when you pay at the store, you provide your bank card. In this way, the control and the ownership of the data stays with you.

  > The adoption of verifiable credentials is another fundamental part of the SSI concept. Verifiable credentials use a digital signature for identity claims by combining public-key hashing cryptography and privacy-protection techniques to convert credentials like ID cards to digital versions.

  > In “Self-Sovereign Identity,” [Johannes Sedlmeir](https://www.fim-rc.de/Paperbibliothek/Veroeffentlicht/1359/wi-1359.pdf) makes a clear distinction between two concepts too often mixed: “identity” and “identifiers”. What we are experiencing in today’s Web are some external organizations identifying us as citizens, community members, customers, etc. But this isn’t our “identity.” Those are identifiers.

* [Myths about SSI](https://jolocom.io/blog/myths-about-ssi/) Jolocom

The idea that as a user of SSI I have complete sovereignty over my digital identity is often misunderstood. At its core, SSI is about my digital identity being under my own control, so I can decide to whom I show my data, when, and for what.

  > Decentralized identity (DID) is a way for users to own their identity, using specific credentials to verify their identity to applications. These credentials, called Verifiable Credentials, enable you to do this. Verifiable Credentials are identity attestations that come from a trusted issuer, like proof of a workplace, student IDs, or official memberships.

* [Digital Identity: Past; Present; Future](https://labs.hypersign.id/posts/ssi-intro/) Hypersign
  > As a result of limited and known users there was no layer of identity and authentication in the design of internet framework. With the invention of the World Wide Web (WWW), the users made it a common platform for data sciences. Various sectors of society like health and finance have started using the internet for their services.

  > Eventually, SSI will give people a super simple way to do the following and more:
  > 
  > 1. Protect sensitive identity information like SSN and birthdates to reduce the likelihood and impact of identity theft
  > 2. Securely prove your identity or things about yourself in a way that institutions can trust
  > 3. Maintain privacy and reduce the ability for corporations or nefarious actors to track you without your consent
  > 4. Conveniently get access to services you need without usernames and passwords

* [The Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) Basics](https://santandergto.com/en/the-self-sovereign-identity-ssi-basics-what-is-it/) Santanderigo
  > The very center of the digital identity is your documents: from your National ID or Passport to your degrees, mobile phone number, bank account number, or your medical records. Anything that is intrinsically bound to you is your data and therefore your identity. While talking about SSI these are called Verifiable Credentials (VC).

* [What is decentralized identity?](https://www.csoonline.com/article/3665692/what-is-decentralized-identity.html) In CSO
  > The DID model allows you to establish a relationship between your private key (your blockchain wallet) and your citizenship.  The issuing authority signs off on the truth of your claim and, thereafter, third parties can check your public key to see that the holder of the private key is in fact a British citizen.

  > Our goal has been to completely abstract away the complexity of the ever-changing landscape so organizations can focus on the important stuff—what product to build, and how to take it to market. Teams shouldn’t have to “pick winners” and wager what to build on. Their products should be interoperable with multiple ecosystems. That’s what Trinsic is providing, out-of-the-box.

  > When the Internet was built, it was done so in a way that you would not know who you were connecting to. To get rid of this loophole, the TCP/IP protocol was introduced, which gives us the address of the computer we are connecting to, but nothing about the person, organisation or thing we are communicating with! We can see how that be potentially dangerous for any online user, making your devices highly susceptible not only to hacking but also to identity theft.
