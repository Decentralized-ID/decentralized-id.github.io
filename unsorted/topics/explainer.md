  > “Our identities have no bodies, so, unlike you, we cannot obtain order by physical coercion. We believe that from ethics, enlightened self-interest, and the commonweal, our governance will emerge. Our identities may be distributed across many of your jurisdictions. The only law that all our constituent cultures would generally recognize is the Golden Rule. We hope we will be able to build our particular solutions on that basis. But we cannot accept the solutions you are attempting to impose.” — John Perry Barlow

Trust, as always in security, is essential to this new class of relationships and must be established and then protected from abuse. Ease of use, it turns out, is a key factor in protecting that trust and promoting the adoption of good identity patterns. I’m sure that I could have learned these lessons in some other way, but I’ll never forget my half year answering to a pseudonym.

  > As S. Shakthi and I noted in a recent [research paper](https://journals.openedition.org/samaj/6279), digital identity systems are widely seen as datafiers by virtue of their core property of reducing the person to machine-readable data. A datafier is a system that performs the crucial operation of converting the physical into digital. A different, contrasting view is also emerging in research: digital identity systems are increasingly seen as platforms, i.e. “technological building blocks” on which different types of complements can be constructed.

  > the [metasystem guarantees the fidelity of the credential exchange](https://www.windley.com/archives/2021/06/ssi_interaction_patterns.shtml). Credential fidelity comprises four important attributes. Credential exchange on the identity metasystem:
  > 
  > 1. Reveals the identifier of the issuer
  > 2. Ensures the credential was issued to the party presenting it
  > 3. Ensures the credential has not been tampered with
  > 4. Reveals whether or not the credential has been revoked

  > In chaotic systems such as those that the discipline of physics seeks to describe, there is also the concept of the “self-organizing principle,” which dictates a tendency for chaotic systems to organize themselves. While this might be a tendency in physics, organization usually needs a nudge in the right direction in the identity world. Proper attention to requirements and a good change control process are a crucial part of the equation.

* [Authentic Digital Relationships](https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/08/authentic_digital_relationships.shtml) 2020-08 Phil Windley
  >  Self-sovereign identity (SSI) systems offers an alternative model that supports richer relationships. Rather than provisioning identifiers and accounts in an administrative system where the power imbalance assures that one party to the relationship can dictate the terms of the interaction, SSI is founded on peer relationships that are co-provisioned by the exchange of decentralized identifiers. This architecture implies that both parties will have tools that speak a common protocol.

Self-sovereign identity Definition <-its quite good

Self-sovereign identity (SSI) is rooted in the belief that individuals have the right to an identity independent of reliance on a third-party identity provider, such as the state or any other central authority. Its implementation requires the development of technical standards, as well as socio-political adaptations rooted in legal amendments in order to be successful.

  > Decentralized digital identities are only possible due to cryptography. One of the cornerstones is asymmetric encryption. A key pair is generated using a cryptographic process. The pair consists of a public and a private key. As the names suggest, the private key must remain private and the public key can be shared.

the relationship view of identity, the nature of authentic digital relationships, the trust bases of identity systems, and the architecture of the identity metasystem, including decentralized identifier communication and the self-sovereign Internet. He then explores how to operationalize digital relationships and the potential of generative identities (e.g., verifiable credentials) and credential exchange. He concludes with a deep dive into self-sovereign identities in production: the UK National Health Service staff passport, Bonifii’s MemberPass for credit unions, the International Air Transport Association Travel Pass, and others.

What we are experiencing in today’s Web are some external organizations identifying us as citizens, community members, customers, etc. But this isn’t our “identity.” Those are identifiers.

  > Decentralized identity (DID) is a way for users to own their identity, using specific credentials to verify their identity to applications. These credentials, called Verifiable Credentials, enable you to do this. Verifiable Credentials are identity attestations that come from a trusted issuer, like proof of a workplace, student IDs, or official memberships.

* [Digital Identity: Past; Present; Future](https://labs.hypersign.id/posts/ssi-intro/) Hypersign
  > As a result of limited and known users there was no layer of identity and authentication in the design of internet framework. With the invention of the World Wide Web (WWW), the users made it a common platform for data sciences. Various sectors of society like health and finance have started using the internet for their services.

Eventually, SSI will give people a super simple way to do the following and more:

1. Protect sensitive identity information like SSN and birthdates to reduce the likelihood and impact of identity theft
2. Securely prove your identity or things about yourself in a way that institutions can trust
3. Maintain privacy and reduce the ability for corporations or nefarious actors to track you without your consent
4. Conveniently get access to services you need without usernames and passwords
* [Crossfunctionality](https://docs.centre.io/blog/crossfunctionationality) Centre

* [The Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) Basics](https://santandergto.com/en/the-self-sovereign-identity-ssi-basics-what-is-it/) Santanderigo
  > The very center of the digital identity is your documents: from your National ID or Passport to your degrees, mobile phone number, bank account number, or your medical records. Anything that is intrinsically bound to you is your data and therefore your identity. While talking about SSI these are called Verifiable Credentials (VC).

* [What is decentralized identity?](https://www.csoonline.com/article/3665692/what-is-decentralized-identity.html) In CSO
  > The DID model allows you to establish a relationship between your private key (your blockchain wallet) and your citizenship.  The issuing authority signs off on the truth of your claim and, thereafter, third parties can check your public key to see that the holder of the private key is in fact a British citizen.

  > Our goal has been to completely abstract away the complexity of the ever-changing landscape so organizations can focus on the important stuff—what product to build, and how to take it to market. Teams shouldn’t have to “pick winners” and wager what to build on. Their products should be interoperable with multiple ecosystems. That’s what Trinsic is providing, out-of-the-box.

  > When the Internet was built, it was done so in a way that you would not know who you were connecting to. To get rid of this loophole, the TCP/IP protocol was introduced, which gives us the address of the computer we are connecting to, but nothing about the person, organisation or thing we are communicating with! We can see how that be potentially dangerous for any online user, making your devices highly susceptible not only to hacking but also to identity theft.

  > The public keys, as the name implies are there to view anytime and are used for exchanging information and can be revoked, however, the private key is for the account holder himself, be that an issuer, a verifier, or a subject. It is only through a private key that one can pass on his credentials using his DID to an issuer who then validates the credentials and sends them to the verifier using his DID.

  > issuers or verifiers can only access the information shared by the DID holder. This information exchange can occur through [various technologies, like NFC](https://nftnewstoday.com/2022/10/03/nft-applications-in-the-supply-chain/), QR, or Bluetooth. [Zero-knowledge proofs](https://nftnewstoday.com/2022/09/15/immutable-x-layer-2-scaling-solution-for-nfts/) are applied to restrict full information access. 2022-09-15
