* [Announcing Schema Markup Validator: validator.schema.org (beta)](http://blog.schema.org/2021/05/announcing-schema-markup-validator.html)

SDTT is a tool from Google which began life as the [Rich Snippets Testing Tool](https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2010/09/rich-snippets-testing-tool-improvements) back in 2010. Last year Google [announced plans](https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2020/07/rich-results-test-out-of-beta) to migrate from SDTT to successor tooling, the [Rich Results Test](https://search.google.com/test/rich-results), alongside plans to "deprecate the Structured Data Testing Tool". The newer Google tooling is focused on helping publishers who are targeting specific schema.org-powered [searc](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/search-gallery)[h features](https://www.blogger.com/) offered by Google, and for these purposes is a huge improvement as it contextualizes many warnings and errors to a specific target application.
