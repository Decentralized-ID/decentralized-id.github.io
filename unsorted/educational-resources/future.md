  > After a look into the past and present, we now fast-forward to the year 2040, where we meet Julia and accompany her through her everyday life. In four different IAM future scenarios, which can be viewed separately, we will understand how life under total surveillance feels for Julia. In times where identity chaos prevails, we can see what it means when Julia can no longer be sure about her digital identity, with only her physical identity being certain. In a world dominated by mega corporations Julia‘s experiences with her employer show us the far-reaching significance and influence such corporations have gained in relation to IAM. Finally, we experience how Julia is able to regain her informational self-determination thanks to her identity wallet - Self-Sovereign Identity 2.0.

They are active participants in the cities we live and work together and need to be engaged in designing better cities and managing the data about themselves. This is not important only for respecting citizens’ rights, but it is crucial to building sustainable services and humane cities.
