## Literature
* [Providing Assurance and Scrutability on Shared Data and Machine Learning Models with Verifiable Credentials](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/351575047_Providing_Assurance_and_Scrutability_on_Shared_Data_and_Machine_Learning_Models_with_Verifiable_Credentials)

This paper introduces a software architecture and implementation of a system based on design patterns from the field of self-sovereign identity. Scientists can issue signed credentials attesting to qualities of their data resources. Data contributions to ML models are recorded in a bill of materials (BOM), which is stored with the model as a verifiable credential. The BOM provides a traceable record of the supply chain for an AI system, which facilitates on-going scrutiny of the qualities of the contributing components. The verified BOM, and its linkage to certified data qualities, is used in the AI Scrutineer, a web-based tool designed to offer practitioners insight into ML model constituents and highlight any problems with adopted datasets, should they be found to have biased data or be otherwise discredited.

To address trust and privacy issues in IOBP, this paper presents a Blockchain-based Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) approach. The SSI concept is combined with a registry proof smart contract to provide an efficient privacy-preserving solution. The proposed approach is applied to the pharmaceutical supply chain case study and implemented on the Ethereum Blockchain
