# Aries

* [Aries Agent Test Harness Enhancement Project](https://www.idlab.org/en/aries-agent-test-harness-enhancement-project/) IDLab
  > At this stage of the AATH Enhancement Project, two factors helped define its broad content:
  > - The gap between AIP 2.0 constituent RFCs and the current implementation of the AATH tests
  > - Requirements from Interac with respect to AIP 2.0
* [0430 machine readable governance frameworks](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/concepts/0430-machine-readable-governance-frameworks/README.md) 2021-10-20
  > Explains how governance frameworks are embodied in formal data structures, so it's possible to react to them with software, not just with human intelligence.

  > In a Self Sovereign Environment supported by Hyperledger Indy / Aries agent framework, Mediator Agent is one of the essential components that acts as postman service between Issuer /Verifier Aries Agent and Mobile Agent.
* [Introducing Hyperledger Aries Framework JavaScript 0.2.0](https://www.hyperledger.org/blog/2022/07/06/introducing-hyperledger-aries-framework-javascript-0-2-0) Hyperledger 2022-07-06
  > The new Hyperledger Aries Framework JavaScript release (0.2.0) contains some incredible steps forward. Especially in our goal to make the framework AIP 2.0 compliant. AIP 2.0 compliance will not only ensure the framework supports the latest standards and protocols, but it will also greatly increase interoperability and make it more useful outside of the Hyperledger Indy ecosystem.

  > “This approval is further evidence that Hyperledger Aries is a breakout success for the Hyperledger community,” said Brian Behlendorf, General Manager for Blockchain, Healthcare and Identity at the Linux Foundation. “Convergence on common libraries for the exchange of credentials will help speed the development of urgently-needed solutions and systems, ranging from education to finance to the fight against the pandemic. Aries is key to that convergence.”

  > The TSC commended the Aries project during the meeting for the project’s highly diverse contributors. Achieving a high number of organizations contributing to a project at Hyperledger is often a challenge. Congratulations are due to those participating in and supporting the Aries Project.

  > Most of Hyperledger Indy’s development occurred prior to the completion of the standard DID Specification by the W3C and, as a result, identifiers written to one network are currently not resolvable on other networks. A new did:indy DID Method will fix that and make it easier for decentralized identity products and services to interoperate across different Indy networks.
* [Hyperledger SSI Ecosystem](https://dev.to/jakubkoci/hyperledger-ssi-ecosystem-4j2p) 2022-08-16 Jakubkoci
  > There are three projects under the Hyperledger umbrella related to digital identity. Hyperledger Indy, Aries, and Ursa. [...] describe their purpose and how they’re related to each other.

## Aries \ Indy \ AnonCreds the dialogue continues

  > Standards such as OIDC and mDL are all now in dialogue with W3C, AnonCreds, Aries, etc. Mobile is a predominant technology, just like the way laptops were once upon a time. To reduce consumer friction and drive adoption, convergence of all these different technologies is required inside a mobile environment

  > While no technology runs perfectly on every device, a signal strength of Aries, AnonCreds, and Indy is that they work on the vast majority of current devices and systems, including $35 smart phones and low powered IOT/embedded devices. They represent the most inclusive way into this technology, which is an important factor in their popularity.

  > Using the [self-sovereign identity](https://www.ledgerinsights.com/tag/self-sovereign-identity/) solution Hyperledger Aries, almost everything works peer to peer between the license issuer and the pilot and between the pilot and the verifier.

  > DID:Key, originally specified in the W3C Credentials Community Group (CCG), is a DID “pseudo-method” that allows static, pre-existing, and/or pre-published public keys to function like traditional DIDs — they can be queried, stored, issued against, and resolved to return valid DID documents.

  > Most other options are subtly locked to a specific blockchain and its particularities, which a self-sovereign identity (SSI) novice is unlikely to notice until months into a project based on it. A few open-source libraries exist to sidestep this infrastructural lock-in, but these are more like primitives for assembling an SSI toolkit than ready-to-go, developer-friendly libraries. DIDKit, on the other hand, is ready to start processing real-world VCs with non-repudiable signatures right out the box.

* [Indicio.Tech releases Aries Mediator Agent](https://indicio.tech/blog/indicio-tech-advances-decentralized-identity-with-release-of-critical-open-source-technology/) 2020-12-31
  > The Indicio Mediator Agent is the company’s latest contribution to Aries Cloud Agent Python (ACA-Py) and the Aries Toolbox. Following RFC 0211: Mediator Coordination, Indicio built on the work of the open-source community to make mediation interoperable and vendor agnostic. This expands the opportunities for mobile wallet implementations.
