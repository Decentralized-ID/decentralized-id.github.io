## Company Stories

* [Patient-Centric Identity Management for Healthcare with Jim St-Clair](https://northernblock.io/patient-centric-identity-management-for-healthcare/)

I began working with Lumedic in January of this year, specifically focused on digital identity standards, especially in self-sovereign identity, and also continuing to work in HL7. Lumedic is part of Providence Health Systems, and we play a very active role in several HL7 initiatives for health IT and data exchange. It’s very complementary to the work we’re doing with groups like Sovrin, the Trust over IP Foundation, and so on.

* [The Human Colossus Foundation will present its Dynamic Data Economy -DDE concept at the DIA conference in Brussels](https://humancolossus.foundation/blog/dde-dia)

Promising advances in digital personal health empower patients. Technologically, we could shift from symptom based intervention to prevention and early treatment.  But advanced innovations also generate debates on trust in sharing intrusive data and regulatory compliance. You can find details regarding our panel presentation [here](https://www.diahome.org/en/conference-listing/meetings/2022/03/dia-europe-2022/agenda/29/precision-prevention-in-a-dynamic-data-economy?ref=PrecisionPreventioninaDynamicDataEconomy).

* [A Digital Staff Passport for hospital facilities, DIZME voted best solution at SHACK22 hackathon](https://infocert.digital/a-digital-staff-passport-for-the-safe-mobility-of-staff-in-hospital-facilities-dizme-has-been-voted-as-the-best-solution-at-shack22-hackathon/) Infocert

The hackathon held by INTEROPen, a leading organization to support & accelerate the delivery and adoption of Interoperability Standards in health & social, in partnership with NHS (National Health System) was aimed at developing innovative solutions for the management of access and safe mobility of staff in hospital facilities.

* [Simplify medical supply orders with SSI: Techruption innovation project](https://www.brightlands.com/en/brightlands-smart-services-campus/brightlands-techruption-SSI-simplifies-medical-supply-orders)

Participants in this co-creation use case were TNO, CZ, Rabobank and Accenture. The developed solution can be applied in other industries as well. For example in public services, which are often offered by a network of organisations that are all required to comply with high administrative standards.

## Pilot

* [Self-Sovereign Identity and Blockchain in the Healthcare Industry](https://knowledge.wealize.digital/en/blog/blog/ssi-at-healthcare-industry) Wealize Digital

Healthcare is a key case-use of the SSI model employing blockchain given the significance and scalability of this sectoral. In this article, we give you details about a pilot project developed for the Andalusian Health Service in Spain to evidence the feasibility of a vaccination card according to the Alastria Self-Sovereign Identity system based on Blockchain technology.

## explainer

* [How decentralised identity & verifiable credentials will transform the world of healthcare](https://www.htworld.co.uk/insight/decentralized-identity-verifiable-credentials-healthcare/) HealthTech World

When a medical accrediting agency provides a digitally signed certificate, the healthcare practitioner and owner of that certificate holds the credential in a digital wallet. The details of the credential such as the time stamp in which the certificate was given and how long it is valid for, can be optionally held within a blockchain network, digitally linked to the certificate, this process is called ‘anchoring’.

* [Accessing Medical Records Anywhere](https://academy.affinidi.com/accessing-medical-records-anywhere-a-use-case-for-verifiable-credentials-81a248f9b746) Affinidi
  > this workflow doesn’t involve any third-party to store your medical data and this also means no worry about medical data storage policies and the laws associated with it. The holder completely owns his or her medical data and stores it exclusively in his or her digital wallet, thereby making it secure and hassle-free.

* [Verifiable Credentials set to Revolutionize Health and Safety Compliance](https://blog.dock.io/verifiable-credentials-set-to-revolutionize-health-and-safety-compliance/) Dock

By integrating with Dock and utilizing verifiable credentials, the process of verifying a workers qualifications goes from analysing paper-based certificates and calling each educational body to certify the legitimacy of it, to having the accreditations sitting in a tamper-proof digital wallet, with a digital signature signature from the issuing body certifying the legitimacy.

* [TheirCharts](https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2022/01/15/theircharts/) Doc Searls 2022-01-15

If you’re getting health care in the U.S., chances are your providers are now trying to give you a better [patient experience](https://www.epic.com/software#PatientEngagement) through a website called MyChart.

This is supposed to be yours, as the first person singular pronoun My implies. Problem is, it’s TheirChart.

* [Advances in health "must ensure self-sovereign identity"](https://healthcareglobal.com/digital-healthcare/advances-health-must-ensure-self-sovereign-identity?page=1) Healthcare Global

Meanwhile [a new report](https://orchahealth.com/patients-seek-digital-health-to-reduce-pressure-on-the-nhs/) has found that the majority of the British public is willing to embrace digital healthcare tools  such as apps and digital therapies prescribed by a trusted healthcare professional.

Shaw adds: “The vital point to make is this: innovations in health technology must ensure self-sovereign identity.

## Devices

[In 2021, #RuggedIoMD becomes an #IIoT category](https://wider.team/2020/12/23/2021ruggediomd/) 2020-12-23

So there’s demand for a new category of IoT and #IoMD that survives and thrives despite these challenges. Very low power consumption. Lots of storage and caching to hold on through power outages. Ruggedized for use outside clinics. Easy and cheap to field-repair. Lots of smarts inside so they work without an internet tap. Many flavors of connectivity to exploit opportunities as they knock. Open sourced, the better to adapt to new and unplanned problems.

* [Rugged Identity: resilience for Identity of Things to bad latency, signal, power, physical integrity. Mars, war zones, bad neighbors, Great Firewalls.](https://iiw.idcommons.net/11C/_Rugged_Identity:_resilience_for_Identity_of_Things_to_bad_latency,_signal,_power,_physical_integrity.) by Phil Wolff

Problem: So, what happens when you can’t call home to conduct an identity conversation? You’re on Mars and the latency is long. You’re in Haiti and the bandwidth is very limited during a storm. You’re in a war zone and your signal is noisy due to interference.

Rugged Identity is hoped-for resilience from very long latency, noisy signal, low bandwidth, interrupted connections, very low power computing and radio, power outages, and attacks on physical integrity like device tampering.

For patients who have a smartphone, they can directly view and manage their medical credentials on their wallet application; for patients who are equipped with feature phones, they can interact with their credentials via a dedicated USSD menu; for those who don’t have a phone, the medical credentials will be stored in a printed QR code.

## Business
* [The Future of Healthcare Relies on Adaptation](https://auth0.com/blog/the-future-of-healthcare-relies-on-adaptation/) auth0

Most healthcare organizations are and should be, focused on their core business pursuits, such as patient care or processing insurance claims. Information security and identity management is not their core business, yet is a critical factor in compliant, secure business operations.

## Policy

* ["Member as API" - The Interoperability and Patient Access final rule and Verifiable Credentials](https://www.pocketcred.com/post/member-as-api-the-interoperability-and-patient-access-final-rule-and-verifiable-credentials)

The Interoperability and Patient Access final rule (CMS-9115-F) delivers on the government's promise to put patients first, giving them access to their health information when they need it most and in a way they can best use it. As part of the MyHealthEData initiative, this final rule is focused on driving interoperability and patient access to health information by liberating patient data using CMS authority to regulate Medicare Advantage (MA), Medicaid, CHIP, and Qualified Health Plan (QHP) issuers on the Federally-facilitated Exchanges (FFEs).

* [What SMART on FHIR Means for the Future of Healthcare](https://auth0.com/blog/what-smart-on-fhir-means-for-the-future-of-healthcare/) Auth0

The Substitutable Medical Applications and Reusable Technologies (SMART) platform promises to solve these data fragmentation challenges by standardizing how patient data is accessed and shared. And given SMART’s inclusion in the [21st Century Cures Act](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/05/01/2020-07419/21st-century-cures-act-interoperability-information-blocking-and-the-onc-health-it-certification), the platform will become the standard protocol for accessing electronic health records (EHRs) in the near future. 2020-05-01

- We have to get to protocol/standards like we did with email
  - It will be messy and competitive with new players who emerge and offer more freedom
  - Those who can’t adapt will lose ground - need to be willing to let go
  - Messaging apps: Signal/What’s APp - PRESSURE...eventually someone will make it so that they work together and scoop up everyone’s business
