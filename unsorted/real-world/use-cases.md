There is momentum here, and a need to start building out much of what was discussed.

Doc introduced the session with the slide deck [here](https://www.slideshare.net/dsearls/day3iiw-sesion), wearing his hat as a founding member of [Customer Commons](http://customercommons.org), the .org working on the Intention Byway discussed at earlier IIW sessions and described in [this blog](https://customercommons.org/2021/04/27/a-new-way/), posed later.

His case is that the incumbent e-commece system hasn’t progressed past its dependence on the cookie, and perhaps never will; and that there is a need to stand up an alternate model, built on asynchronous pub-sub messaging and compute nodes that run apps that don’t have to come from the stores of Apple and Google.

First examples of target areas (where communities are already active) are food distribution in Michigan and real estate in Boston. Hadrian Zbarcea led the discussion of both, using slides from the deck above.

* [Manu responds](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-did-wg/2021Jan/0003.html)
  > Could DIDs and VCs help with systems architected with Zero Trust in mind? Yeah, probably:
> 
> 1) You could use VCs to prove that you should have certain levels of access to certain systems. Checking this could happen automatically, but while ensuring that you're "live" and not some bot.
> 2) Logs could be kept of which VCs were used when to receive the authority to do something.
> 3) ZCAPs could be used to provide fine-grained access to very specific resources, even behind the firewall, within an organizations systems.
> DIDs could power much of this... but shouldn't promise any of it. The closest we could probably get to what you're asking, Adrian, is to align the Zero Trust Architecture principles to how DIDs and VCs can help -- primarily around: identity verification (VCs), login authentication (DIDs), least-privilege access (ZCAPs, Confidential Storage), and HTTP API access authorization (ZCAPs).

* [More from Adrian](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-did-wg/2021Jan/0004.html)
  > The most important message from the SolarWinds hack and much of the ransomware havoc is that our systems are not set up for individual accountability or independent audit.
> 
> The VC and ZCAPs perspective is inadequate. As an SSI community we need to address the separation of concerns between authentication, authorization, and audit as equally important and needing a harmonized best-practice perspective. Standardized EDVs are table stakes but not terribly relevant to the protocols that link authentication, authorization, and audit. Confidential Storage should be adopting the protocols that connect authentication, authorization, and audit rather than introducing protocols narrowly scoped to the narrow and obvious role of encryption at rest.
