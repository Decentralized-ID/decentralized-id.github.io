  > A story appeared in the NY Times about Tim Berners-Lee’s vision for the web and Solid-Inrupt that are working towards fulfilling it. The article included a quote from Kaliya, and has stirred up an active thread on the CCG mailing list.

> Others say the Solid-Inrupt technology is only part of the answer. “There is lots of work outside Tim Berners-Lee’s project that will be vital to the vision,” said Kaliya Young, co-chair of the Internet Identity Workshop, whose members focus on digital identity.
> 
> Mr. Berners-Lee said that his team was not inventing its own identity system, and that anything that worked could plug into its technology.

  > He has technology and a start-up pursuing that goal. Can he succeed?

  > - Anyone familiar with TBL’s view of Decentralized Identity?
  > - Is there anyone from the Solid project or Inrupt a member of CCG?

  > No. 7: Protecting Our Personal Data

Called a "self-sovereign identity," it would keep the data with the individual. People would use the Secure ID for online interactions; any data sent would be encrypted. But the key is that those online entities would not store the data themselves. So, there would be no more huge, centralized places where personal data could be stolen.
