* [NO NEED FOR SUPERHUMANS!: A practical guide to ethics in socio-technical systems design](https://trustoverip.org/blog/2022/03/18/no-need-for-superhumans/) TOIP 2022-03-18
  > Of course we are not as Albert Camus once said, ‘wild beasts loosed upon this world’, all of us have a moral compass and a sense of what is right and wrong, no-one intends for their product or service to cause harm.   Neither are we superhuman, able to always understand the perspectives of all stakeholders or foresee the consequences of every cool feature or elegant line of code, nor indeed can we forecast how our products and services will be used for good or ill. Lisa called on all of us to remember that “technology is not a product, but a system”,  and  gave us practical steps to help us tap into our innate moral compass and design for those systems with the human experience and human flourishing at its heart.

  > Maybe it’s because of the nature of my job in decentralized identity consulting, but lately, I’ve been seeing a lot of conspiracy theories on social media about Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI). People criticize the way it’s being implemented and warn about the negative consequences it will have. It’s almost as if people don’t realize that organizations are already monitoring and influencing us and that Google and social media algorithms have been instrumental in this.

The earliest discussion of the phrase I could find is a [blog post](https://blog.lizardwrangler.com/2011/08/04/extending-our-reach-many-layers-of-user-sovereignty/) from August 4th, 2011 by the “Chief Lizard Wrangler” herself, [Mitchell Baker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitchell_Baker) the CEO of Mozilla. In it she prophetically describes user sovereignty as the consequence of new “engines” that are “…open, open-source, interoperable, public-benefit, standards-based, platforms…” She also makes the critical link between the philosophy of openness and standards-based interoperability with that of identity management and personal data dominion. 2011-08-04

The use of facial recognition by law enforcement agencies has become common practice, despite increasing reports of [false arrests](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/24/technology/facial-recognition-arrest.html) and [jail time](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/29/technology/facial-recognition-misidentify-jail.html). While there are various downsides to facial recognition technology being used at all, including fears of mass surveillance and invasion of privacy, there are flaws within facial recognition technologies themselves that lead to inaccurate results. One such major challenge for this still-burgeoning technology is gender-based inaccuracies. 2020-12-29

The Spotlight Report, “[Consumer Sensitivity to Location Tracking by Websites and Mobile Apps](https://me2ba.org/spotlight-report-3-me2b-alliance-validation-research-consumer-sensitivity-to-location-tracking-by-websites-and-mobile-apps/)”, was developed to validate the Location Commitment scoring criteria in the [Me2B Alliance Safe & Respectful Technology Specification](https://me2ba.org/flash-guide-2-what-is-the-me2b-respectful-tech-specification/). The specification, produced by the Me2B Alliance’s Respectful Tech Spec Working Group, is designed to provide a standard for measuring safe and ethical behavior in connected technology.

The Me2B Alliance (“Me2BA”)[3](https://me2ba.org/spotlight-report-3-me2b-alliance-validation-research-consumer-sensitivity-to-location-tracking-by-websites-and-mobile-apps/#footnotes) is a nonprofit creating a safe and just digital world through standards development and independent technology testing. At the core of our work is our Respectful Technology Specification[4](https://me2ba.org/spotlight-report-3-me2b-alliance-validation-research-consumer-sensitivity-to-location-tracking-by-websites-and-mobile-apps/#footnotes), currently in development, which provides an objective standard for measuring safe and ethical technology behavior.

- Consumers are aware that legal policies exist on connected technologies and that they should read them, but they continue to choose to largely ignore them.
- 55% of survey participants did not understand that a TOS/TOU agreement is a legal contract. This has significant implications because a key requirement for legally binding contracts is mutual assent, which means that both parties have a “meeting of the minds” and must understand they’re entering into a contract.
- None of the interview participants were aware of tools that explain or rate privacy policies and TOS/TOU documents, and half said that a score would not change their behavior.
- 66% of survey respondents believe that privacy policies protect the business, while 50% say they protect the consumer. It’s questionable that privacy policies protect either the individual or the business, as they are primarily legal notices, disclosures of how data is used by the technology and the companies behind it. Moreover, 39% of respondents erroneously thought that the privacy policy was a contract [between them and the company].

* [Backchannel: A relationship-based digital identity system](https://www.inkandswitch.com/backchannel/) Ink and Switch

Using Backchannel as a model example, we propose four design principles for trusted digital relationships.

Based on this testing, we outline common user experience challenges and recommended solutions.


* [Identity and Consistent User Experience](https://www.windley.com/archives/2021/11/identity_and_consistent_user_experience.shtml) Phil Windley

There's a saying in security: "Don't roll your own crypto." I think we need a corollary in identity: "Don't roll your own interface." But how do we do that? And what should the interface be? One answer is to adopt the user experience people already understand from the physical world: connections and credentials.

* [Survey Finds Customers Frustrated With Passwords, Open to Biometrics](https://findbiometrics.com/survey-finds-customers-frustrated-passwords-open-biometrics-7102106/) FindBiometrics

Passwords were a major point of contention in that regard, with a strong majority (68 percent) of consumers indicating that it is difficult to remember and key in a large number of passwords. Nearly half (44 percent) believe that biometric authenticators are easier to use, while 34 percent would prefer to use them as their primary means of identity

The speakers will also explore learnings from everyday people in the validation research around the certification mark as well as share recommendations for tech makers.

The complex ecosystem where manifold transactions can be automatically enabled by smart contracts contributes, at least in principle, to establish greater transparency about data use towards the many parties involved. However, the mere fact of building such a verifiable and traceable architecture does not automatically translate into understandable communications, easily applicable instructions and smooth transactions for human beings.

The first international agreement on how refugees could handle the issue of missing or incomplete identity documents resulted from the Arrangement of 5 July, 1922, which was a meeting of the League of Nations. Among other things, the conference established a uniform [“identity certificate” for Russian refugees](https://www.refworld.org/docid/3dd8b4864.html), between one and two million of whom [had been displaced by various conflicts over the previous decade](https://www.icrc.org/ar/doc/assets/files/other/727_738_jaeger.pdf).

A key part of this is continuity and longevity: a personal data store is for life, so the institutions providing personal data stores should be designed for decades (centuries, even). Whatever particular corporate form they take, legal safeguards relating to continuity and longevity of purpose need to be built into how they operate.
