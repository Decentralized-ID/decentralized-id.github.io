Let us know what youâ€™d like to see going forward and how we can build guidance and documentation around it!

* [Self Sovereign Identity Wikipedia Article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-sovereign_identity) that has been started, but can clearly still use a lot of attention. (h/t [@Drabiv](https://twitter.com/Drabiv/status/1102166656019849216))
* [Self-Sovereign Identity : Decentralized digital identity and verifiable credentials](https://www.manning.com/books/self-sovereign-identity)Â Manning

It combines a clear, jargon-free introduction to this blockchain-inspired paradigm shift with interesting essays written by its leading practitioners. Whether for property transfer, ebanking, frictionless travel, or personalized services, the SSI model for digital trust will reshape our collective future.
* [DIF "Frequently Asked Questions" Knowledgebase](https://blog.identity.foundation/dif-monthly-22/)

DIF has launched a massive Decentralized IdentityÂ [Knowledgebase](https://identity.foundation/faq/), structured as a long series of frequently-asked questions and answers. This synthesizes a year of educational efforts in the interop WG, blog posts, newsletters, and many other DIF inputs in a format we hope will be helpful as a reference and onboarding document throughout the decentralized identity space.

* [Global Verifiable Credential Adoption](https://trinsic.notion.site/trinsic/Global-Verifiable-Credential-Adoption-78c7e4c5f2a34a228a55d03db54ab399)Â Trinsic (Notion)

The new wave of digitization has put digital identity, what used to be mostly behind-the-scenes work, and the flaws of current identity systems, under the spotlight. Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) has emerged as a concept and guiding principles of how we should build the next generation of the Internet by putting users at the center of their identities and data. It is also a movement led by technologists to build open Internet protocols and compliant technology aligned with SSI principles. On its way to becoming a key piece of the Internet infrastructure, SSI will soon reach most peopleâ€™s lives and businesses, making it important for everyone to learn what it is and how it is going to influence us. This course will provide the knowledge and understanding you need to figure out what you want to do with self-sovereign identity next.
