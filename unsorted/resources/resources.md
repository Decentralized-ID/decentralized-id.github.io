The new wave of digitization has put digital identity, what used to be mostly behind-the-scenes work, and the flaws of current identity systems, under the spotlight. Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) has emerged as a concept and guiding principles of how we should build the next generation of the Internet by putting users at the center of their identities and data. It is also a movement led by technologists to build open Internet protocols and compliant technology aligned with SSI principles. On its way to becoming a key piece of the Internet infrastructure, SSI will soon reach most peopleâ€™s lives and businesses, making it important for everyone to learn what it is and how it is going to influence us. This course will provide the knowledge and understanding you need to figure out what you want to do with self-sovereign identity next.
