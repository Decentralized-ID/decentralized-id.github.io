  > The first follows the ways in which identities were designed and managed in computer systems. [...] The second history examines the evolution of paper-based identity systems that emerged in Europe. [...] The last section of the paper brings these two histories together and explains why the underlying technological design of SSI aligns with Western liberal democratic values in a way that the earlier digital identity systems designs do not.

  > Commonly associated with blockchain and the Self-Sovereign Identity movement, Verifiable Credentials are in fact an old idea.  It is instructive to break down their essential properties and examine the pioneering examples.

  > Self-Sovereign Identity has deep roots. It did not just emerge in 2016 after a blog post was written. It did not fail to exist when wikipedia editors denied it subject integrity with the stated message: "good luck with that".

Nothing to prevent players to take advantage of SSI. They may add something small and useful aspects to the protocols.

The hope is that our stuff is super interoperable. So you can actually really leave.

Facebook is interesting because it was based on the .edu domain. Small network. Solving for the endstate that we see now is different than starting back then.

Zero-knowledge proofs and trustless networks may require high-trust environments for adoptions.

  > In 2021 Santa decentralizes his list, no longer relying on children’s Real Names in compliance with kid privacy laws. Self-sovereign identity lets kids ask Santa, confident their identities are authenticated (right toys to the right kid) & that he uses verified naughty/nice data.
