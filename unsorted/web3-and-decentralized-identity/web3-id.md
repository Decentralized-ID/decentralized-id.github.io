  > The technical name for the model at work here is called the Direct Presentation model. A credential is issued, and then held for a long period of time with intermittent voluntary presentations to many different verifiers. To put that back into our example, my auto club issues me a card, which I hold in my wallet for years (maybe decades!), and I might choose to show that card to a garage when I need a tow, or possibly to a store to get a discount.

  > Whether it’s the enforcement of legal identities, platform lock-in, or more implicit social norms, the logic of individualized identity was baked into web 2.0. With the advent of web 3.0, we have a chance to do things differently.
* [Self-Sovereign Identity, smart contracts and Web 3.0](https://hackernoon.com/self-sovereign-identity-smart-contracts-and-web-30-4dm375d) Hackernoon
  > Public blockchain and smart contracts are a convenient and viable cloud for security-critical information and allow to implement more complex schemes. For example, your service requires that the user's identity be confirmed by some external KYC provider, or there must be an always available master public key to distribute software updates in the network (relevant for IoT).

  > All in all, the exponential rise in cases of data breaches and hacks on Web 2.0 applications, calls for a new system that protects users data and privacy on the internet. Additionally, the rapid growth of the decentralized internet means that digital identities are becoming more important than ever as users turn to virtual worlds and metaverses in future.
* [SSI and Music in Web 3.0](https://opulous.medium.com/self-sovereign-identity-and-music-in-web-3-0-148c058dbc30)
  > while our primary goals of financial disintermediation and inclusion are being realized in our existing projects, a greater long-term goal remains: to return to musicians and artists the control of their own data. Music publishing companies, record labels, performance rights organizations, and other industry intermediaries have had too much power for too long.

  > Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) is arguably the most effective form of digital identity in Web 3.0. SSI is a user-centric identification method for controlling information. Fully aligned with Web 3.0, SSI eliminates the need to store personal information entirely on a central database and gives individuals greater control over the information they share to protect their privacy.

  > In MetaMUI, users can create their own DID by submitting their personal information(KYC) to one of the Sidechain Operators, and the operator will decide whether approving or denying the request depending on the status of the submitted data. Once the request is approved, the user’s personal data get hashed, and the hashed data is safely stored in the user’s device.
