  > With current technologies, we can have a user sign-in using their keys (e.g. [Sign-In with Ethereum](https://login.xyz/)), have [credentials issued](https://spruceid.dev/) to their identifier (and store them), and use capabilities to retrieve and present those credentials.

  > Web3Auth aggregates OAuth (Google, Twitter, Discord) logins, different wallets, and existing key management solutions, and provides dApps/wallets a familiar experience that fits every user. Mobile, web, and blockchain agnostic, Web3Auth fits right into your application or wallet.

  > A key opportunity Web3 presents in the identity space is the ability to interact with a user's blockchain data. This presents two benefits: enriching user profiles and streamlining the login process with federated logins using storage wallets.
* [Ethereum's Identity Layer - Impact of Ethereum Presentation](https://blog.spruceid.com/presentation-ethereums-identity-layer-impact-of-ethereum/) Spruce ID
  > We had the opportunity to present on Ethereum's Identity Layer, covering the evolution of decentralized identity, and how Ethereum presents an incredible opportunity for users to truly own and control their identity and data. Check out that talk in this post.

* [.bit account](https://www.did.id/) is such an inclusive data container that you can put any type of data into it. Tons of Web3 apps will provide service for you after indexing relevant data stored in your .bit account.
* [Why We Issue Identity Tokens](https://www.civic.com/blog/why-we-issue-identity-tokens/) Civic
  > In 2017 we published [Chainauth](https://vinnylingham.com/civic-enabling-the-future-of-privacy-digital-security-with-chainauth-b79d61904d4c), a mechanism for anchoring verifiable credentials on Bitcoin, and in 2021 we released [Civic Pass](https://www.civic.com/solutions/), a multi-chain token protocol, in conjunction with [identity.com](https://identity.com/).[...]

  > Why, if we had Chainauth, based on verifiable credentials, did we release Civic Pass, a token protocol very similar to SBTs?

  > DSI is a multi-chain self-sovereign identity protocol enabling users to maintain a unified identity over Web3. It allows users to manage all their  as well as on-chain and off-chain credentials through a single identity which allows them to build their reputation and own their data and identity in a trustless and secure manner.

  > Spruce is excited to announce the upcoming launch of Tezos Profiles (TZP) in early May. TZP is a web application that helps users regain control of their digital identity for use across platforms. It allows users to create portable verified profiles by demonstrating control over their public social media and by self-attesting information. These verified profiles are then linked to Tezos acco

  > 
  > “What everyone else is missing is usage.” Today there are few if any dApps using DID, thus few users care about having an effective DID system, and decentralized apps have no incentive to prioritize it.

## Soulbound Tokens

  > The paper “[Decentralized Society: Finding Web3’s Soul](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4105763)” has generated much discussion as a more advanced and beneficial way of applying an NFT-type technology to encode “social relationships of trust” in Soul-Based Tokens.
* [Soulbound tokens - Otters for DAOs?](https://otterspace.mirror.xyz/Cec_bTSsLgcohuaV5dkOJTbaYuFB6tF8jhxzN_30k1A) Otterspace
  > Our vision is to give DAOs the tools to better represent the varying nature of membership, improve member engagement, coordination and distribution of power and permission. By doing so, we also aim to progressively improve their autonomy and permissionlessness, while surfacing clear paths and incentives for individual members to deepen their participation. 💪

  > The lack of a universal identity standard is holding us back; it’s harming collaborative processes and opening the door for bad actors and scams which breed mistrust and stigmatize the entire industry.
* [Souls, Tokens, and Verifiable Credentials](https://indicio.tech/souls-tokens-and-verifiable-credentials/) Indicio Tech
  > Even little bits of what might be considered ‘mostly harmless’ private information when correlated can present unexpected privacy problems. What this means is that the only information safely applicable for use in a Soul Bound Token is so impersonal as to be of little practical use.
