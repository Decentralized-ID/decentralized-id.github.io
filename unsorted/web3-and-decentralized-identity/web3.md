Called a "self-sovereign identity," it would keep the data with the individual. People would use the Secure ID for online interactions; any data sent would be encrypted. But the key is that those online entities would not store the data themselves. So, there would be no more huge, centralized places where personal data could be stolen.

  > Moxie argues that protocols evolve slowly, while platforms evolve quickly. That’s because a platform can make decisions without waiting for a whole crowd of others to reach consensus. But here’s the thing — some protocols don’t need to evolve quickly. As long as a ‘base protocol’ is versatile enough to let people create and express things in an unlimited range of fit-for-purpose application protocols, it can be as stale and boring as it likes. And it’s precisely the decentralisation, versatility, and stability of these base protocols — HTTP, email, and yes, Bitcoin and Ethereum — that allow platforms to innovate so quickly on top of them.
