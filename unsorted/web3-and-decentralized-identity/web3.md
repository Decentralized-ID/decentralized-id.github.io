what gives Aggregators their power is not their control of supply: they are not the only way to find websites, or to post your opinions online; rather, it is their control of demand. People are used to Google, or it is the default, so sites and advertisers don’t want to spend their time and money on alternatives; people want other people to see what they have to say, so they don’t want to risk writing a blog that no one reads, or spending time on a social network that because it lacks the network has no sense of social.

MSFT Explains: [Decentralized identity: The Direct Presentation model](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/identity-standards-blog/decentralized-identity-the-direct-presentation-model/ba-p/3071981)

When we use identity-related credentials in the real world, they often have different properties than digital credentials. There are two separate ceremonies in most cases: issuance and presentation. If you have spent any time at a department of motor vehicles or a passport office, you’ve seen what an issuance ceremony can be – it is usually an intensive process, but the tradeoff is that once you have a credential like a driver’s license or passport, you can use that credential for multiple purposes, at multiple places, over a long period of time.

The technical name for the model at work here is called the Direct Presentation model. A credential is issued, and then held for a long period of time with intermittent voluntary presentations to many different verifiers. To put that back into our example, my auto club issues me a card, which I hold in my wallet for years (maybe decades!), and I might choose to show that card to a garage when I need a tow, or possibly to a store to get a discount.

Moxie argues that protocols evolve slowly, while platforms evolve quickly. That’s because a platform can make decisions without waiting for a whole crowd of others to reach consensus. But here’s the thing — some protocols don’t need to evolve quickly. As long as a ‘base protocol’ is versatile enough to let people create and express things in an unlimited range of fit-for-purpose application protocols, it can be as stale and boring as it likes. And it’s precisely the decentralisation, versatility, and stability of these base protocols — HTTP, email, and yes, Bitcoin and Ethereum — that allow platforms to innovate so quickly on top of them.

* [UNISOT ID – Part 1](https://unisot.com/unisot-id/)

Since identity is such a central part of society, UNISOT, through its UNISOT ID service, offers our customers control over their data. Under self-sovereign identity model users who have one or more identifiers (something that enables a subject to be discovered and identified) can present claims relating to those identifiers without having to go through an intermediary. In the following sections we will outline how SSI can change the way you interact with others on the Internet as well as in the real world.

A story appeared in the NY Times about Tim Berners-Lee’s vision for the web and Solid-Inrupt that are working towards fulfilling it. The article included a quote from Kaliya, and has stirred up an active thread on the CCG mailing list.

> Others say the Solid-Inrupt technology is only part of the answer. “There is lots of work outside Tim Berners-Lee’s project that will be vital to the vision,” said Kaliya Young, co-chair of the Internet Identity Workshop, whose members focus on digital identity.
> 
> Mr. Berners-Lee said that his team was not inventing its own identity system, and that anything that worked could plug into its technology.

Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) is arguably the most effective form of digital identity in Web 3.0. SSI is a user-centric identification method for controlling information. Fully aligned with Web 3.0, SSI eliminates the need to store personal information entirely on a central database and gives individuals greater control over the information they share to protect their privacy.

DAOs are, I think, one of the best illustrations of the problem with a lot of these Web3 projects: They are trying to find technological solutions that will somehow codify very complex social structures. A lot of them also seem to operate under the assumption that everyone is acting in good faith, and that project members’ interests will generally align—a baffling assumption given the amount of bad actors in the crypto space.

No. 7: Protecting Our Personal Data

Called a "self-sovereign identity," it would keep the data with the individual. People would use the Secure ID for online interactions; any data sent would be encrypted. But the key is that those online entities would not store the data themselves. So, there would be no more huge, centralized places where personal data could be stolen.

A Self-Sovereign Digital Twin™ (SSDT) is a digital twin which is anchored in a decentralized trust network using W3C’s DIDs)Standard (for MOBI’s community, this is the Integrated Trust Network, or ITN). By using the SSDT and W3C’s VC Standard, the controller of the SSDT can participate as an autonomous economic agent in trusted transactions through issuing VCs and Verifiable Presentations (VPs). For MOBI’s community, this is done using Citopia Marketplace. Citopia utilizes the network effect and Zero-Knowledge (ZK); allows for the onboarding of SSDT; and enables VCs and VPs.
