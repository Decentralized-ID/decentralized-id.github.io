  > In today’s episode, we talk about his new book “Currency Cold War” and relationship, and lack thereof, between digital currency and identity.
* [IPR - what is it? why does it matter?](https://identitywoman.net/ipr%e2%80%8a-%e2%80%8awhat-is-it-why-does-it-matter/)
  > At the time they kept worrying about how they could collaborate and they sensed that they needed to have IPR dealt with, but I couldn’t understand what they were going on about. This small thing delayed them working together for a long time. They literally had to spin up a new organization, get new bylaws developed and get everyone to join and sign off on the IPR regime before they could formally talk together about how to get all work to align and come up with one protocol.
* [Why do you care about identity?](https://wider.team/2022/01/18/phil-cares-about-identity/) Phil Wolff 2022-01-18

I love that it’s more than a technical discussion. It’s laws. Sociology. Politics and civics. Commerce. Psychology. Ethics. History. Economy. All the humanities.

Identity touches everything. It always will. Computation and communication continue their pervasion, and identity spreads with them.

* [Batman & Identity: Crash Course Philosophy #18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TFCMK4i2lo&t=10s)

Hank explores different ways of understanding identity – including the Indiscernibility of Identicals, and essential and accidental properties. In what ways does affect identity? In what ways does it not? What does it mean for a thing to persist over time?

  > We all know online abuse can be incredibly damaging and [Pew](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2017/07/11/online-harassment-2017/) puts it like this: “In its milder forms, [online abuse] creates a layer of negativity that people must sift through as they navigate their daily routines online. At its most severe, it can compromise users’ privacy, force them to choose when and where to participate online, or even pose a threat to their physical safety.” 2017-07-11
