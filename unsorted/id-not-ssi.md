  > In chaotic systems such as those that the discipline of physics seeks to describe, there is also the concept of the “self-organizing principle,” which dictates a tendency for chaotic systems to organize themselves. While this might be a tendency in physics, organization usually needs a nudge in the right direction in the identity world. Proper attention to requirements and a good change control process are a crucial part of the equation.

When you set up a new account, you are often asked to create a password and choose a security question and answer (e.g., What is your mother's maiden name?). Answering security questions based on personal information when you log in to an app or system is called knowledge-based authentication (KBA).

In a screenshot shared on social media, a Cloudflare employee’s email address was visible, along with a popup indicating the hacker was posing as an Okta employee and could have initiated a password reset.

Last year Google [announced plans](https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2020/07/rich-results-test-out-of-beta) to migrate from SDTT to successor tooling, the [Rich Results Test](https://search.google.com/test/rich-results), alongside plans to "deprecate the Structured Data Testing Tool".
