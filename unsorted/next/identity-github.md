## /WebOfTrustInfo

>The Web of Trust is a buzzword for a new model of decentralized self-sovereign identity. It’s a phrase that dates back almost twenty-five years, the classic definition derives from PGP.

\#RebootingWebOfTrust holds bi-annual design workshops where many of the ideas in SSI\DID were formed.

In advance of each workshop, all participants produce a one-or-two page topic paper on either:

* A specific problem that they wanted to solve with a web-of-trust solution, and why current solutions (PGP or CA-based PKI) can't address the problem?
*  A specific solution related to the web-of-trust that you'd like others to use or contribute to?

The workshop itself also produces technical whitepapers, this Repository holds a record of the progression of thought in SSI, since November, 2015.

* [One Page List of Rebooting WoT Literature]({{ site.baseurl }}/literature/rebooting-web-of-trust/)

### RWoT Design Workshop

* [White Papers, Specifications & Proofs of Concept](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot1-sf/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/white-papers--specifications---and-proof-of-concept-code.md) 
  >Our goal for this initial #RebootingWebOfTrust design workshop is to:
  >
  > * Focus on the creation of the next generation of decentralized web-of-trust based identity systems.
  > * To generate 5 technical white papers on topics decided by the group that will have the greatest impact on the future"
  >
  > To this end, I thought it would be useful to define what is a white paper, and as some people desire to go beyond this, what is a specification and proof of concept code.

## Ethereum
* [ERC: Lightweight Identity #1056](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/1056) —This ERC describes a standard for creating and updating identities with a limited use of blockchain resources. An identity can have an unlimited number of delegates and attributes associated with it. Identity creation is as simple as creating a regular key pair ethereum account, which means that it's fee (no gas costs) and all ethereum accounts are valid identities. Furthermore this ERC is fully DID compliant.
* [ERC-1484: Digital Identity Aggregator #1495](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/1495) —A protocol for aggregating digital identity information that's broadly interoperable with existing, proposed, and hypothetical future digital identity standards.
* [ERC725](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/725) 
  * The following describes standard functions for a unique identifiable proxy account to be used by humans, groups, organisations, objects and machines
* [ERC735](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/735) -  The following describes standard functions for adding, removing and holding of claims.
  - These claims can attested from third parties (issuers) or self attested.
* [EIP712](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/f29527ab39357548b06b29e937a48f06ae099de7/EIPS/eip-712.md) - This is a standard for hashing and signing of typed structured data
* [ERC: Ethereum Claims Registry #780](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/780)
* [EIP-1078](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/ed621645c8f3bc5756492f327cda015f35d9f8da/EIPS/eip-1078.md) - 
This presents a method to replace the usual signup/login design pattern with a minimal ethereum native scheme, that doesn’t require passwords, backing up private keys nor typing seed phrases.
