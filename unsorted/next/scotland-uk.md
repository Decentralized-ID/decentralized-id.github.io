  > 2. To develop a solution that is designed with and for members of the public (service users) and that stakeholders can support.
  > 3. To develop a solution that works: is safe, secure, effective, proportionate, easy to use, and accessible; and forms part of public sector digital services.
  > 4. To develop a solution where members of the public can be confident that their privacy is being protected.
  > 5. To develop a solution that brings value for money and efficiencies in the delivery of digital public services
