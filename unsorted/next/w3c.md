# W3C

### Organization
* [W3C to become a public-interest non-profit organization](https://www.w3.org/2022/06/pressrelease-w3c-le.html.en) 2022-06 W3C [discussion](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-credentials/2022Jun/0063.html)
  > As W3C was created to address the needs of the early web, our evolution to a public-interest non-profit is not just to continue our community effort, but to mature and grow to meet the needs of the web of the future.
* [does the CCG have any thoughts about possible changes to W3C itself?](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-credentials/2022Apr/0067.html)  Daniel Hardman (Saturday, 9 April)
  > This major organizational overhaul to the W3C is also happening at a time of unprecedented activity and change for the internet. Will the web support crypto and Web3 industry proposals? How will the web support advertising? What should be the baseline web browser security standards?
