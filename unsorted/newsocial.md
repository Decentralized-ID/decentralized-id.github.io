Set-up Presentation:

- Silos and echo chambers?
- Countermeasures?
- Pink Checkmark system? Verify all accounts or continue 2-class system
- Can we still make money?
- Moderation
- Clients and API openness - on what axes will they compete? Can they compete on algos? Community curation?
- How important is authenticity? Each tweet signed?
- Editable cheeps?
- Delete cheeps?
- Mike Jones: Listening to Daniel’s ION presentation, I asked from the POV of a naïve person, what are these ION DIDs good for in the first place; his answer was
- Daniel wants identities that Twitter can’t take away from Donald Trump
- Child pornographers would also then be sovereign over their identifiers
- Kim: People select their own echo chambers
- Juan: Echo chamber / child porn dynamics have a lot in common (HBO Documentary “into the storm”)
- Erica: Social media as a way to advertise, finding markets. Want to market to people who are interested
- Small business, organic marketing, micro-commerce
- Bullying, social problems, child protection

Secure Scuttlebutt, Decentralized Identifiers, Key Management

Dmitri expressed interest in SSB and reported using but then having lost their key (when switching/resetting devices?). Expressed Frustration (with the key recovery process). Have question, how could SSB use DIDs?

Charles responded that there is a draft PR on [DID Spec Registries](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-spec-registries/) adding a SSB DID method a few days ago.
