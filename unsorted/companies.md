  > Most other options are subtly locked to a specific blockchain and its particularities, which a self-sovereign identity (SSI) novice is unlikely to notice until months into a project based on it. A few open-source libraries exist to sidestep this infrastructural lock-in, but these are more like primitives for assembling an SSI toolkit than ready-to-go, developer-friendly libraries. DIDKit, on the other hand, is ready to start processing real-world VCs with non-repudiable signatures right out the box.
