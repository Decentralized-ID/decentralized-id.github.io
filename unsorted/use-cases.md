>[SSI Meetup](https://ssimeetup.org) is an open, collaborative community to help SSI evangelists around the world, independent of company interests or standards. Our main mission is to help you connect with other SSI enthusiasts and create a dynamic, local, yet globally connected community.

...[Monthly webinars](https://ssimeetup.org/blog/), the [presentations](https://www.slideshare.net/SSIMeetup) and [video](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSqSTlKdbbCM1muGOhDa3Og) of which are invaluable resources.

## SSI Meetup Pages on Decentralized-id.com

It's not sustainable to keep them all listed on one page, so I've split off all the presentations on Specs and Open Standards. This process will continue as each presentation is given more individual attention.

* [**SSI-Meetup - Main Page**]({{ site.baseurl }}/organizations/ssi-meetup/) 
* [**SSI-Meetup on Open Standards and Implementations**]({{ site.baseurl }}/organizations/ssi-meetup/open-standards/)
  - Verifiable Claims, DIDs, DID Auth, DID Resolution, various DID Methods, etc.
  
## Slideshare Presentations

It would be nice to create a page breaking down each of these presentations with supporting links.
