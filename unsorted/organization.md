* [Non-binary Thinking will Accelerate Digital Sovereignty (with Rouven Heck)](https://northernblock.io/non-binary-thinking-will-accelerate-digital-sovereignty-with-rouven-heck/) NorthernBlock
  > Now, if we take two communities within the SSI space – the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF) and the Trust over IP Foundation (ToIP). I will sometimes hear people talking positively about one and negatively about the other. But why is this happening? Don’t we all have the same underlying values? Aren’t we all looking to better our lives through digital sovereignty?
  > 
  > I think the answer to this is clear and we need to get away from thinking in a binary manner about anything in our space. And if you really look at the overlap between both these communities: they are quite large.

  > An ecosystem is a community of living organisms interacting with each other and their physical environment.  When you hear that definition, you might priture a pristine nature landscape, but that definition can also apply to how businesses, individual or organization interact with one and other.  This talk is about natural ecosystem and how we can adapt nature's lessons to our industry ecosystems.
* [Goodbye, physical identities: How organizations can prepare for digital identity challenges](https://www.biometricupdate.com/202208/goodbye-physical-identities-how-organizations-can-prepare-for-digital-identity-challenges) Philipp Pointner, Biometrics Update
    > He raises some interesting points about the [increasing number of digital identity wallets](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2022-02-21-govt-tech-trends-2022-press-release) being offered by states and national governments, and how, with the rise in digitalization, there are more opportunities for bad actors to acquire and misuse your information. He leaves us with a few key  attributes to look for in a secure digital identity system.
