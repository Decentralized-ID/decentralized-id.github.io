Governmental entities act as important intermediaries for many transactions occurring in today´s society.

In the era of misinformation, digital fraud has become a challenge that is essential to address.

Governments and the societies they serve need technology capable of verifying the authenticity of the information they handle.

As we build the European regulatory framework, in the transfer from paper to digital, a key question arises: how to share official documents, called ‘evidences’ or ‘credentials’ in a way that can be trusted?

### Data Governance Act

* [A critical fork in the data road?](https://medium.com/mydex/a-critical-fork-in-the-data-road-1eb29c5a42a8) MyData

Is the EU discussion about data portability missing a key point?

In its discussion of data portability the EU rightly recognises the economic importance of this issue, stressing that “market imbalances arising from the concentration of data restricts competition, increases market entry barriers and diminishes wider data access and use.”

it is likely that many dApp developers now need an identity solution that preserves privacy but ensures compliance – which is exactly the solution that we are building at SelfKey.
EU [DATA GOVERNANCE ACT MEETS TOIP FRAMEWORK](https://trustoverip.org/blog/2022/01/13/data-governance-act-meets-toip-framework/) TOIP

The DGA defines an “intermediary” that facilitates processing and sharing of data for individuals and organizations to “…increase trust in data intermediation services and foster data altruism across the EU”. In the [MyData](https://mydata.org/declaration/) framework for user-controlled data sharing, intermediaries are called [MyData Operators](https://mydata.org/mydata-operators/) and there is a certification program in place.

* [EU Data Governance Act officially released](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/data-governance-act)
   >foster the availability of data for use by increasing trust in data intermediaries and by strengthening data-sharing mechanisms across the EU
   
One of MyDex CIC’s founders, [Alan Mitchell shares a feeling of Vindication](https://medium.com/mydex/vindicated-cb897fb4e94b) in a post celebrating the companies early articulation of key principles and how the EU’s proposed new Data Governance Act aligns with that.
  > These providers will have to comply with a number of requirements, in particular the requirement to remain neutral as regards the data exchanged. They cannot use such data for other purposes. In the case of providers of data sharing services offering services for natural persons, the additional criterion of assuming fiduciary duties towards the individuals using them will also have to be met.

* [Data Exchange Board to Improve the EU Data Governance Act](https://mydata.org/2020/12/09/why-we-need-a-data-exchange-board-to-improve-the-eu-data-governance-act/)

* [EU Data Governance Act](https://blog.meeco.me/eu-data-governance-act/) (Meeco)

> We welcome the regulation as a needed common ground for clarifying the role of data intermediaries, building trust in these intermediaries and setting the direction for data governance, including the emergence of digital human rights.
> 
> In this context we offer the following suggestions:
> 1. Explicitly include individuals as active participants in the definitions [...]
> 2. Clarify the scope of the data sharing services (Art. 9 (2)) and extend it to include services that empower the data subject beyond compliance.
> 3. Foster the growth of intermediaries, which offer new technologies and have the greatest likelihood of success in Europe if supported by the Data Governance Act.
> 4. Open silos and implement soft infrastructure such as standards & open APIs to accelerate uptake and interoperability between data sharing services.
> 5. Foster eco-systems and demonstrate the value through practical use-cases.
> 6. Create a level playing field for sustainable data sharing by providing funding to pioneers at the forefront of developing data eco-systems

The [EU Commission published the long-awaited Data Act](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_22_1113) on February 23, 2022. This is a progressive legislative proposal to increase access to data for the users of connected products suchs as Iot devices and related services. It is a significant move towards realising the [MyData principle](https://mydata.org/declaration/) of portability, access, and re-use as well as the principle of interoperability. It will potentially also move the needle towards the shift from formal to actionable rights in terms of the right of data portability. With such a progressive agenda, the proposal will certainly also face significant opposition and counter-lobbying from those who stand to benefit from the status quo.

Without a clear vision on identity, society will have no agency since the capability to produce future value (data) is not under regional, nor national, nor international regulated control.

Therefore it is important to have a good overview of what is happening in different parts of the world to see if we can not combine innovative solutions.

* [SSI Mandate Service by Visma Connect B.V.](https://essif-lab.eu/ssi-mandate-service-by-visma-connect-b-v/) ESSIF LAB

The SSI mandate service is a generic and holistic approach to provide and request mandates. Mandates are SSI credentials signed by the dependent that can be requested by either the dependent or authorized representative. These credentials can be used to prove to a verifier that the authorized representative is authorized to act for specific actions on behalf of the dependent.

* [OnboardSSI by Quadible](https://essif-lab.eu/onboardssi-by-quadible/) ESSIF-LAB

The concept of SSI was designed with the citizen and privacy in mind. However, existing implementations lack user-friendliness (e.g. showing hash codes to users), creating potential barriers in users’ adoption. OnboardSSI focuses on providing a secure and user-friendly wallet solution creating an easier way for citizens to manage their identity.

Since parties are autonomous, their trust is highly subjective. As a consequence, the idea of having 'trusted registries', 'trusted issuers' that do not take this subjectivity into account basically act as [(centralized) authorities](https://essif-lab.pages.grnet.gr/framework/docs/terms/authority), denying that parties are autonomous.

  > The European Commission developed the [SSI (Self-Sovereign Identity) eIDAS bridge](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/ssi-eidas-bridge), an ISA2 funded initiative, to promote eIDAS as a trust framework for the SSI ecosystem. It assists a VC (Verifiable Credential) issuer in the signing process, and helps the verifier to automate the identification of the organization behind the issuer’s DID (Decentralized Identifier). Simply by “crossing” the eIDAS Bridge, a Verifiable Credential can be proven trustworthy in the EU.

  > Why then is eIDAS v1 not seen as a success? There are many reasons; from parts of the regulation that focused or constrained its use into the public sphere only, to the lack of total coverage across all of the EU. Likely the key missing piece was that the cultural climate was not yet ripe and the state of digital identity was really not ready. Too many technical problems were yet to be solved. Without these elements the realized state of eIDAS should not be unexpected. All this said, eIDAS v1 laid very important groundwork and created an environment to gather important learnings to allow eIDAS v2 to realize the hoped for levels of success and adoption.

Especially interesting is the SSI eIDAS bridge, which adds legal value to verified credentials with the use of electronic certificates and electronic seals. However, it’s also possible to derive national eIDs notified in eIDAS, which are eIDAS linked by issuing a verifiable credential with a qualified certificate according to the technical specification.

The objective of the topic is to develop, implement and scale up the European Digital Identity framework, based on the revised eIDAS regulatory framework as well as the exchange of evidence as set out in article 14 the Single Digital Gateway Regulation. The broader objective of European Digital Identity is to improve citizen’s access to highly trusted and secure electronic identity means and trust services such as digital signatures, improve citizens’ possibilities to use them and improve their ability to control over sharing their personal identity data.

* [Global Identity Networks: How to Leverage Them for Business Benefit](https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2022/blog/global-identity-networks-to-leverage-business-benefit) Kuppinger Cole

The uptake of eIDAS (facilitating cross-border acceptance of eIDs) is low relative to the technical capacity of states; [only 15 of the 27 Member States](https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/35274ac3-cd1b-11ea-adf7-01aa75ed71a1) able to fulfil the regulation’s requirements of accepting the eIDs of other Member States for public services.

The EU Commission did reflect on the effectiveness of the regulation in its [Impact Assessment](https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/35274ac3-cd1b-11ea-adf7-01aa75ed71a1), and is developing a revision of it. There are multiple revision options being discussed, but thus far, the preferred option would establish a framework that provides citizens with optional use of a personal digital wallet

The new proposal will pivot on some of the more key issues that held back the original framework. For example, instead of enforcing a single, rigid ID that openly reveals everything about an individual indefinitely, the eIDAS 2.0 structure can now potentially employ a flexible, self-sovereign identity (SSI) that puts control of all identifying information entirely into the hands of the end-users they pertain to, in both public and private partnership frameworks.

The intention of the European Commission is to allow – or even force – acceptance in a wide range of sectors in the public and private domain and thereby ensure that identities are as wisely usable as possible (interoperability). The principle of consent will also be met, as it is already fulfilled with current eID solutions notified under eIDAS and other EU regulations, such as GDPR and PSD2.

While the structural difference between SSI approaches and conventional centralised or federated eID schemes is, on one level, profound (full control over data and identity with the user; no third-party intermediary between the user and the service provider), on another level, these differences may also appear highly abstract to ordinary users. What societal and economic consequences they may unfold remains, so far, little understood, also because research on the real social and economic effects of SSI solutions is only beginning.

When it comes to identity management the involvement of the government can be a tricky topic. It needs to be involved to enable access to public services, adapt legislature and guarantee equal access for its citizens. However, it should not be able to control or monitor all aspects and activities of its citizens. Self-sovereign identity (SSI) might for some imply, that a citizen is suddenly able to issue his own ID-card, which isn’t the case. Governments are still the primary source of foundational identities."

In their final recommendations, the researchers from INNOPAY and TNO argue that in view of the social value of digital data exchange, the government would do well to play a driving role in the further consolidation of the SSI playing field. That starts with creating clarity about the relationship between the Digital Government Act and the EU Digital Identity Wallet.

The ID wallet for the digital driver's license is not only technically immature. Government data show: the allocation was not transparent, security checks were incomplete - and the possible direction is questionable.
