# W3C

### Organization
* [W3C to become a public-interest non-profit organization](https://www.w3.org/2022/06/pressrelease-w3c-le.html.en) W3C - [Public-Credentials](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-credentials/2022Jun/0063.html)
  > As W3C was created to address the needs of the early web, our evolution to a public-interest non-profit is not just to continue our community effort, but to mature and grow to meet the needs of the web of the future.
* [does the CCG have any thoughts about possible changes to W3C itself?](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-credentials/2022Apr/0067.html)  Daniel Hardman (Saturday, 9 April)
  > This major organizational overhaul to the W3C is also happening at a time of unprecedented activity and change for the internet. Will the web support crypto and Web3 industry proposals? How will the web support advertising? What should be the baseline web browser security standards?

## Membership

* [Hedera Hashgraph Joins World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)](https://hedera.com/blog/hedera-hashgraph-joins-world-wide-web-consortium-w3c-new-did-method-published-by-w3c-credentials-community-group)
  > We welcome Hedera as a contributing member to the W3C DID Working Group and congratulate their team for reaching this milestone of a published implementation of the latest W3C DID Identifiers v1.0 draft,” said Ivan Herman
* [Block Joins W3C](https://twitter.com/brockm/status/1526723285102120960) [@brockm](https://twitter.com/brockm)
  > Today, we became a member of the [@W3C](https://twitter.com/w3c), as part of our commitment to building open standards for an open web. We are committed to advancing and adopting decentralized and privacy-preserving standards for self-sovereign digital identity that benefits all. Not centralized platforms.

### WebAuthn

* [W3C WebAuthn V2 Now a Standard](https://self-issued.info/?p=2160) Mike Jones
  > While remaining compatible with the original standard, this second version adds additional features, among them for user verification enhancements, manageability, enterprise features, and an Apple attestation format. ([Recommendation](https://www.w3.org/TR/2021/REC-webauthn-2-20210408/)) ([CTAP also approaching standardization](https://self-issued.info/?p=2155).
* [Web Authentication: An API for accessing Public Key Credentials Level 2](https://www.w3.org/TR/2021/PR-webauthn-2-20210225/). This specification defines an API enabling the creation and use of strong, attested, scoped, public key-based credentials by web applications, for the purpose of strongly authenticating users.
* [Second Version of W3C Web Authentication (WebAuthn) advances to Proposed Recommendation (PR)](https://self-issued.info/?p=2149)
  > The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has published this [Proposed Recommendation (PR)](https://www.w3.org/TR/2021/PR-webauthn-2-20210225/) Level 2 specification, bringing the second version of WebAuthn one step closer to becoming a completed standard. While remaining compatible with the original standard, this second version adds additional features, among them for user verification enhancements, manageability, enterprise features, and an Apple attestation format.
* [Near-Final Second W3C WebAuthn and FIDO2 CTAP Specifications](https://self-issued.info/?p=2143)
  > The [W3C WebAuthn](https://www.w3.org/blog/webauthn/) and [FIDO2](https://fidoalliance.org/fido2/) working groups have been busy this year preparing to finish second versions of the W3C Web Authentication (WebAuthn) and FIDO2 Client to Authenticator Protocol (CTAP) specifications

### Verifiable Credentials

* [Essential Services Delivery coordination using Digitally Verifiable Credentials](https://github.com/bcgov/essential-services-delivery)
  > This repository contains the build, deployment, and application configurations needed to pull a number of separate applications into a single environment and deploy them as a group of interrelated services.
* [bcgov/vc-visual-verifier](https://github.com/bcgov/vc-visual-verifier) - Verifiable Credential Visual Verifier
* [Verifiable Credential Authentication with OpenID Connect (VC-AuthN OIDC)](https://github.com/bcgov/vc-authn-oidc)
  > The integration this document defines is how holders of verifiable credentials can leverage these to authenticate with parties. Note, how the holder became in possession of supported verifiable credentials is out of scope for this integration.
  > 
  > Like any new technology there is adoption required of new concepts, this particular integration aims to provide an easy integration path that allows parties to start leveraging the power of verifiable credentials for user authentication in a non-disruptive fashion. This is achieved by extending the vastly popular OpenID Connect family of specifications.
