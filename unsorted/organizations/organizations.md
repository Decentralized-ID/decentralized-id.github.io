  > The panel will review the concepts of federated identities, authentication, and the role attributes play in managing access to services. They’ll further describe how the InCommon Federation and eduGAIN enable academic collaboration across local, regional, national, and international scales, discuss technical alternatives for participation in InCommon, and delve a bit into how research communities and research cyberinfrastructures manage federated access to their services.

Bedrock is positioned to be an important public identity utility for the maturation of a digital trust marketplace. I will always be here to help when/where I can. Hint: Maybe my new road ahead will help bring additional members to the table.

conversations about digital identity innovation were mostly treated as a developing country issue, with ardent advocates in the West unwilling to acknowledge that digital identity could add value to developed economies. Now, as the world [emerges from the pandemic](https://omidyar.com/a-decade-of-digital-public-goods-holding-up-the-digital-economy-preventing-monopolies-and-safeguarding-freedoms-for-all/), attitudes seem to have taken a 180-degree turn.

These may seem off-topic but Bill Wendell has been engaged with the VRM and IIW community for well over a decade - He has some great ideas on how to reform/transform the real-estate industry with ideas/models our community has been discussing. If you are looking for an opportunity to collaborate and build something transformative I would reach out to him.

Individuals can access with the peace of mind that all relying parties within the ecosystem are present and accountable. Sure, there will still be malicious vendors, but the scope will be more limited. The ecosystem will be much more secure than the current Internet. It will be enough for the participants to take action. Trust is reestablished.
