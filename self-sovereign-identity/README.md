# Self Sovereign Identity (SSI) 
<a href="https://infominer.id"><img src="https://infominer.id/images/infominer.png" align="right" width="150" height="140"></a>
**Articles and documents associated with Self Sovereign Identity Fundamentals.**

This directory was born from [/WebOfTrustInfo/self-sovereign-identity](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/self-sovereign-identity), the original SSI repository. I've done a bit of work over there, and decided to expand my efforts. The reason I got started on this is because I wanted to write an article about SSI, and saw some areas where I think I can help with some of the legwork towards a more complete, and up-to-date set of SSI literature.

In my opinion, the best overall article on the subject is still Christopher Allen's rallying cry: [The Path to Self-Sovereign Identity](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/self-sovereign-identity/blob/master/ThePathToSelf-SovereignIdentity.md). Christopher did an outstanding job of outlining the history of internet identity standards, and introduces [10 Principles of Self-Sovereign Identity](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/self-sovereign-identity/blob/master/self-sovereign-identity-principles.md), currently in revision. 

However, considerable additional material has been created on the subject since then, including some helpful criticism on the principles. I've organized some of my initial thoughts in [/evolution-of-ssi.md](evolution-of-ssi.md).

Then I realized that I should make a more complete survey of the subject, if I want to be thorough. So now I'm collecting as much SSI info as I can, and organizing it here. Once I've completed a review of existing literature on the subject, I'll put it into a google shared doc to encourage further participation.
