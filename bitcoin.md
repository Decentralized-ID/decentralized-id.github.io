## Bitnation

* [Bitnation taps Blockchain tech to aid Refugees](https://www.newsbtc.com/2015/09/09/bitnation-taps-blockchain-tech-to-aid-refugees/)[[**^**](#Bitnation-and-the-United-Nations)]
* [BTCR DID Method](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/didm-btcr/) — The Bitcoin Reference DID method (did:btcr) supports DIDs on the public Bitcoin blockchain. The Bitcoin Reference method has minimal design goals: a DID trust anchor based on the Bitcoin blockchain, updates publicly visible and auditable via Bitcoin transactions, and optionally, additional DID Document information referenced in the transaction OP_RETURN data field. No other Personal Identifiable Information (PII) would be placed on the immutable blockchain.

## Spidchain

* [Spidchain](http://www.spidchain.com/) [[**wp**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B89WE3IIHmy1Z0ZSSWVmVEtaaG8/view)]
   * "offers a platform for self-sovereign identity, including desktop and mobile apps for end-users. It uses Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) - backed by optionally Bitcoin or Ethereum - to implement a marketplace for verifiable claims. The Spidchain applications allow individuals to create, recover, and revoke DIDs, to authenticate, to sign and verify files and claims, and more."
