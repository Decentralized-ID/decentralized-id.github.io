Decentralized-id.com is meant to be a collaborative, participatory learning community that strives to support the elaboration and adoption of a self-sovereign identity layer for the internet. 

- **Before any other matter** we are concerned about: 
  - The rampant and widespread exposure of of our personal information by legacy identification systems
  - The potential for totalitarian control over, and the eradication privacy from, future systems.
- **Educational**.  Our primary motivation is to enable ease in navigating the rapidly expanding information ecosystem surrounding decentralised identity. 
- **Impartial**. What is important to us is the needs of the user, and the development of an ecosystem without gatekeepers, built upon a collection of protocols that enable anyone to work within, on-top of, and interoperably within said system.
- **Inclusive**.  Decentralized-ID.com could described as a non-organization of self-affirming members. It is a do-ocracy, comprised of those who share a passion for building a common repository of knowledge, in support of Sovereign Identity. 
- **Not for Profit.**  The purpose of this site is to learn and share knowledge. That said, if there is a particular topic you'd like us to serve more information on, a contribution would surely speed the time to publication.
- **Public Domain** Unless otherwise noted, all the content of this site is released to the public domain. Contributors wishing to retain full rights of their work must specify such, before the time of publication.
