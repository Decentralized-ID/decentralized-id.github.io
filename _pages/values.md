Decentralized-id.com is meant to be a collaborative, participatory learning community that strives to support the elaboration and adoption of a self-sovereign identity layer for the internet. 

Certain values undergird those who share in this work.

\-          **Before any other matter**: we are concerned about the exposure of personal informaiton that our current systems for identification subjects upon its users, and about the potential for totalitarian control over and eradication of any privacy from future systems.

\-          **Educational**.  Our primary motivation is to enable ease in navigating the voluminous information information related to the topic of decentralised identity. It requires new methods for gathering and distributing information, if all identity networks should interoperate in a widespread fashion. As it stands, such information is widely dispersed, requiring dedication both to gather and present. 

\-          **Impartial**.  What is important to us is the needs of the user, and the development of a system without gatekeepers, built upon a collection of protocols that enable anyone to work within, on-top of, and interoperable with said system.

Our goals is not for any particular company, application or organization to "win" or "lose" against the rest. Success comes when we can rise together, each in their own way.

\-          **Inclusive**.  Decentralized-ID.com could better described as an unorganization of self-affirming members. It is a do-ocracy, comprised of those who share a passion for building a common repository of knowledge, in support of Sovereign Identity. 

\-          **Not for Profit.**  The purpose of this site is to learn and share knowledge. That said, if there is a particular topic you'd like more information on, a donation would surely speed the time to publication. Individual contributors are likely to be working independently on paid contracts, consulting, writing, and\or other commercial ventures.

\-          **Public Domain** Unless otherwise noted, all the content of this site is released to the public domain. Contributors wishing to retain full rights of their work must specify such, before the time of publication.
