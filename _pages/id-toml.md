This page has two toml files from [infominer33/SourceCrypto](https://github.com/infominer33/SourceCrypto) embedded into it, with some help from [gist-it.appspot.com](https://gist-it.appspot.com)

## Wish List

* some simple way to check [didecentral.github.io](https://decentralized-id.com) against these lists, and output a list of links that have yet to be included.

* an app that will take a list of links as the input and output a toml file with title\description automatically populated based on metadata..

that would make it a lot easier.. then I just go in and fine tune each entry.

I suppose it would make the most sense to prioritize those objectives, rather than constructing everything by hand.

Scraping a list of links from wherever I want is simple.. so really the two things are checking a list of links against a toml file(s), outputting any links not found in the db already. Another script to construct a toml file grabbing metadata.

@MaciekLaskus suggested I include authors, which is true. I believe I intended to eventually:
  >what's really missing is tagging all of these resources by authors, co-authors, references/citations
  >
  > once this is done, topical tags can be derived algorithmically<br>
