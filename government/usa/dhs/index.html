    <blockquote>
      <p>The DHS S&amp;T SBIR Program was initiated in 2004 with the goal of increasing the participation of innovative and creative U.S. small businesses in federal research and development programs and challenging industry to bring innovative homeland security solutions to reality.</p>

      <p>Solicitation topics are developed by Program Managers in each of the Science and Technology (S&amp;T) Divisions. The annual solicitations consist of topics relevant to the following S&amp;T Directorate organizations: Borders and Maritime Security, Chemical/Biological Defense, Cyber Security, Explosives, and the First Responder Group.</p>

      <p>Similar to the R&amp;D programs of the S&amp;T Directorate, the SBIR topics generally address the needs of the seven DHS Operational Units, i.e., U.S. Coast Guard, U.S. Transportation Security Administration, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Federal Emergency Management Agency, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and U.S. Secret Service, as well as First Responders.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The DHS Science and Technology Directorate (S&amp;T) Silicon Valley Innovation Program (SVIP) is keeping pace with the innovation community to tackle the hardest problems faced by DHS and the Homeland Security Enterprise. SVIP expands DHS S&amp;T’s reach to find new technologies that strengthen national security with the goal of reshaping how government, entrepreneurs, and industry work together to find cutting-edge solutions.\</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>SVIP utilizes the “<a href="https://beta.sam.gov/opp/3da6f22122b94b3d98c03a2483ec7320/view">Innovation Other Transaction Solicitation” (OTS) — HSHQDC-16-R-B0005</a> (refer to document titled: “SVIP OTS Amendment_1_29_2020.pdf”) to engage with organizations that do not usually work with the government in order to carry out prototype projects and possibly transition successful projects to production. This engagement is intended to assist new companies so they have more opportunities to work with DHS through targeted non-dilutive funding and provide opportunities for operational testing and market access. Through SVIP, DHS intends to incentivize product developers to open the aperture of their development roadmaps to include homeland security solutions.</p>

<h3 id="program-phases">Program Phases</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Phase 1	$50-$200K	3-6 months	Proof-of-Concept Demo</li>
  <li>Phase 2	$50-$200K	3-6 months	Demo Pilot-ready Prototype</li>
  <li>Phase 3	$50-$200K	3-6 months	Pilot-test Prototype in Operation</li>
  <li>Phase 4	$50-$200K	3-6 months	Test in Various Operational Scenarios</li>
  <li>Phase 5	As required - Additional Use Cases and Operational Scenarios as DHS Determines</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Phase 5: If DHS determines that additional work is required on a solution to meet mission needs, an SVIP performer may be invited to apply for a Phase 5 award. A Phase 5 is only applicable if DHS determines the solution may address additional use cases and operational scenarios. This Phase may result in a limited number of technology prototypes or licenses to test the prototype in multiple use cases and conditions and may be funded beyond the total $800K Phases 1–4 limits.</p>
