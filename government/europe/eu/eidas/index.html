<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2014.257.01.0073.01.ENG">Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European Parliament</a> and of the Council of 23 July 2014 on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market and repealing Directive 1999/93/EC
    <blockquote>
      <p>(2) This Regulation seeks to enhance trust in electronic transactions in the internal market by providing a common foundation for secure electronic interaction between citizens, businesses and public authorities, thereby increasing the effectiveness of public and private online services, electronic business and electronic commerce in the Union.</p>

      <p>(3) Directive 1999/93/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (3), dealt with electronic signatures without delivering a comprehensive cross-border and cross-sector framework for secure, trustworthy and easy-to-use electronic transactions. This Regulation enhances and expands the acquis of that Directive.</p>

      <p>(11) This Regulation should be applied in full compliance with the principles relating to the protection of personal data provided for in Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (7). In this respect, having regard to the principle of mutual recognition established by this Regulation, authentication for an online service should concern processing of only those identification data that are adequate, relevant and not excessive to grant access to that service online. Furthermore, requirements under Directive 95/46/EC concerning confidentiality and security of processing should be respected by trust service providers and supervisory bodies.</p>

      <p>(12) One of the objectives of this Regulation is to remove existing barriers to the cross-border use of electronic identification means used in the Member States to authenticate, for at least public services. This Regulation does not aim to intervene with regard to electronic identity management systems and related infrastructures established in Member States. The aim of this Regulation is to ensure that for access to cross-border online services offered by Member States, secure electronic identification and authentication is possible.</p>

      <p>(14) Some conditions need to be set out in this Regulation with regard to which electronic identification means have to be recognised and how the electronic identification schemes should be notified. Those conditions should help Member States to build the necessary trust in each other’s electronic identification schemes and to mutually recognise electronic identification means falling under their notified schemes. The principle of mutual recognition should apply if the notifying Member State’s electronic identification scheme meets the conditions of notification and the notification was published in the Official Journal of the European Union. However, the principle of mutual recognition should only relate to authentication for an online service. The access to those online services and their final delivery to the applicant should be closely linked to the right to receive such services under the conditions set out in national legislation.</p>

      <p>The uptake of eIDAS (facilitating cross-border acceptance of eIDs) is low relative to the technical capacity of states; <a href="https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/35274ac3-cd1b-11ea-adf7-01aa75ed71a1">only 15 of the 27 Member States</a> able to fulfil the regulation’s requirements of accepting the eIDs of other Member States for public services.</p>

      <p>The EU Commission did reflect on the effectiveness of the regulation in its <a href="https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/35274ac3-cd1b-11ea-adf7-01aa75ed71a1">Impact Assessment</a>, and is developing a revision of it. There are multiple revision options being discussed, but thus far, the preferred option would establish a framework that provides citizens with optional use of a personal digital wallet</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Europe is on a “Path to a Digital Decade”, which envisions 80% of EU citizens using a digital ID card by 2030. A part of that journey will be self-sovereign identities. Research Analyst Alejandro Leal joins Matthias to continue their discussion on the digital transformation in public services. Self-sovereign identities, the new eIDAS regulation, and the impact of both on how interactions between citizens and the state will change, are a controversial topic in the public discussion as well.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>This report explores the potential of self-sovereign identity (SSI) technologies to ensure secure electronic identification and authentication to access cross-border online services offered by Member States under the eIDAS Regulation. It critically assesses the current literature and reports on the current technological landscape of SSI and existing eID solutions, as well as the standards, communities, and pilot projects that are presently developing in support of these solutions.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Why then is eIDAS v1 not seen as a success? There are many reasons; from parts of the regulation that focused or constrained its use into the public sphere only, to the lack of total coverage across all of the EU. Likely the key missing piece was that the cultural climate was not yet ripe and the state of digital identity was really not ready. Too many technical problems were yet to be solved. Without these elements the realized state of eIDAS should not be unexpected. All this said, eIDAS v1 laid very important groundwork and created an environment to gather important learnings to allow eIDAS v2 to realize the hoped for levels of success and adoption.</p>

      <p>By sharing Verifiable Credentials, users can prove claims about themselves, but how can the credentials verifier trust them, if the only thing it knows about the issuer is its DID? This is indeed the goal of this project and where the eIDAS regulation can help. eIDAS stands for electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market. It ensures legal validity of electronic documents and cross border trust services, such as electronic signatures and seals. To make eIDAS available as a trust framework in the SSI ecosystem, the European Commission developed under this project, the eIDAS bridge.</p>

      <p>It’s currently possible to be eIDAS compliant with SSI, leveraging one out of five scenarios described in the SSI eIDAS legal report by Dr. Ignacio Alamillo Domingo. Especially interesting is the SSI eIDAS bridge, which adds legal value to verified credentials with the use of electronic certificates and electronic seals. However, it’s also possible to derive national eIDs notified in eIDAS, which are eIDAS linked by issuing a verifiable credential with a qualified certificate according to the technical specification.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><strong>Large-Scale Pilots</strong><br>
Before its implementation in the Member States, the European Digital Identity Wallet will be assessed in four large-scale initiatives. These projects aim to evaluate digital identity wallets in real-world scenarios covering numerous sectors. There will be participation from more than 250 private companies and government agencies from 25 Member States as well as Norway, Iceland, and Ukraine.</p>

      <p>The four pilot projects that commenced on 1st April 2023 are as follows:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Potential
          <ul>
            <li>Piloting the use of EUDI wallets for the authorization of payments for products and services by the wallet user/ holder. This includes accessing a digital public service (for example, when trailing to another Member State, a requirement for proof of identity or a necessity to obtain medical prescriptions) and opening bank accounts.</li>
            <li>Use of the EUDI wallet will also include the necessary requirement for signing contracts online, where a secure digital signature is provided.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>NOBID
          <ul>
            <li>The NOBID Consortium is developing a large-scale pilot to prepare, implement and test the EU Digital Identity Wallet. This will involve several banks for the authorization of payments for products and services. They aim to address the issuance of wallets, means of payment by financial institutions and acceptance of retail payments.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>DC4EU (Digital Credentials for Europe)
          <ul>
            <li>The pilot of the wallet across the education sector (by securing education credentials) and the Social Security domain. This will be achieved by deploying and accessing European interoperable digital service infrastructures, including integration, by applying the eIDAS cross-border framework.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>EUWC (EU Digital Identity Wallet Consortium)
          <ul>

    <blockquote>
      <p>The new proposal will pivot on some of the more key issues that held back the original framework. For example, instead of enforcing a single, rigid ID that openly reveals everything about an individual indefinitely, the eIDAS 2.0 structure can now potentially employ a flexible, self-sovereign identity (SSI) that puts control of all identifying information entirely into the hands of the end-users they pertain to, in both public and private partnership frameworks.</p>
