  > Under our analysis of trust and the digital world, we define different types of trust relationships and find out the factors that are needed to ensure a fully representative model.Next, to meet the challenges of digital trust modelling, comprehensive trust model evaluation criteria areproposed, and potential securities and privacy issues of trust modelling are analyzed. Finally, we provide awide-ranging analysis of different methodologies, mathematical theories, and how they can be applied totrust modelling

  > 2. The Concept of Trust: how do we define trust at a high-level and how do we differentiate between technical and human trust? How can we build trust with credential issuers but also with credential holders?
  > 3. The World of Trust Frameworks: what are trust frameworks and what are different types of frameworks being deployed in both the public and private sectors? How are organizations trying to monetize trust frameworks? What’s going right, and what’s going wrong with the way trust frameworks are being implemented?
  > 4. The Importance of Open Source for Trust Creation: why is open source important for achieving digital sovereignty? Is open source the only way to improve transparency, flexibility and accountability?

Through this process, we’re going to learn what may need to change, and what may not need to change. We’re going to get real knowledge there. I will say that what we’re seeing already, is that DIACC and our priorities are really driven by members.
* [Trust Frameworks](https://medium.com/mattr-global/learn-concepts-trust-frameworks-ad96a4427991) 2020-12-24 Mattr Global
  > Trust frameworks are a foundational component of the web of trust. A trust framework is a common set of best practice standards-based rules that ensure minimum requirements are met for security, privacy, identification management and interoperability through accreditation and governance. These operating rules provide a common framework for ecosystem participants, increasing trust between them.

  > He points at the NIST documents about it [Developing Trust Frameworks to Support Identity Federations](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2018/NIST.IR.8149.pdf) published in 2018. He also points at the Canadian government’s definition of standards.
   document that provides a set of agreed-upon rules, guidelines or characteristics for activities or their results. Standards establish accepted practices, technical requirements, and terminologies for diverse fields.”  He goes on to highlight a lot of the work being done in Canada and where it all sits relative to being a standard - “In closing, there are lots of trust frameworks being developed today. But to be truly trusted, a trust framework needs to either apply existing standards or become a standard itself.”

* [OIX White Paper: Trust Frameworks for Identity Systems](https://www.oixnet.org/news-whitepaper/) 2017-04-25 OIX
  > Trust frameworks are not a new concept. They are commonly used outside of the world of digital identities, to govern a variety of multi-party systems where participants desire the ability to engage in a common type of transaction with anyone of the other participants, and to do so in a consistent and predictable manner. In such cases, they are proven to work and scale. Common examples include credit card systems, electronic payment systems and the internet domain name registration system, which all rely on a set of interdependent specifications, rules, and agreements. This set of specifications, rules and agreements is referred to by various names, such as “operating regulations,” “scheme rules,” or “operating policies.” In the world of identity systems they are commonly referred to as a “trust framework.”

* [Managing Trust and Reputation via Trust Registries](https://www.continuumloop.com/managing-trust-and-reputation-via-trust-registries/) 2022-08-23 Continuum Loop
  > The concept behind a Trust Registry is that a Wallet needs to know which decentralized identifiers (DIDs) to “trust” as a source of truth. At many levels, this “trust” translates to “authority” – knowing that somebody, centralized or decentralized, is responsible for maintaining a list of trusted DIDs.

  > Trust registries also need to be interoperable. The [Trust Over IP Foundation](https://www.trustoverip.org/) has a [specification](https://github.com/trustoverip/tswg-trust-registry-tf) for an interoperable trust registry, and ours is the first implementation of this spec. Because of this, Trinsic’s Trust Registry Service is architected so that one ecosystem could reference or incorporate a trust registry from a separate ecosystem if needed.

  > This paper illustrates how TRAIN (Trust mAnagement INfrastructure), an approach based on established components like ETSI trust lists and the Domain Name System (DNS), can be used as a trust registry component to provide a holistic approach for trust management in SSI ecosystems. TRAIN facilitates individual trust decisions through the discovery of trust lists in SSI ecosystems, along with published credential schemas, so that verifiers can perform informed trust decisions about issued credentials.

  > - First, machine-readable governance simplifies how decentralized identity works: The user software handles the rules for information flows and authentication, which are established and published by the entities with authority for governing the use case.
  > - Second, this architecture makes these rules transparent.
  > - Third, and critically, it enables these rules to function offline through caching, which, when you think about it, is an essential feature in any digital identity verification system; trust can’t be dependent on a Wi-Fi signal.
* [Trust Registry or Machine-Readable Governance?](https://indicio.tech/trust-registry-or-machine-readable-governance/) 2021-09-28 Indicio
  > Machine-readable governance is composed of elements that help to establish trust and enable interoperability: trusted participants, schemas (templates for structuring information in a credential), and rules and flows for presenting credentials and verifying them. Machine-readable governance can be hierarchical. Once a governance system is published, other organizations can adopt and then amend or extend the provided system.
