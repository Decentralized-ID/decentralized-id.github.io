  > What if instead, you could securely and selectively share your ID with an expiring link? Your name and photo will be visible but other private details will be blurred out. Your Airbnb now believes you are who you say you are because they also trust the issuer of your digital credential. Likewise, you don’t have to worry that a copy of your full license is on a stranger’s phone forever. Everyone rests easy, and you enjoy the heck out of your vacation.

  > In the offline world, we typically store credentials in a physical wallet — it keeps them all in one place, protects them by keeping them close to our body, and makes them easy to carry around and access when we need them. The job of a digital wallet is no different:
  > 
  > 1. Store your credentials, keys/keycards, bills/receipts, etc
  > 2. Protect them from theft or prying eyes.
  > 3. Keep them handy — easily available and portable across all your devices.

  > Turning identifying features into verified credentials
  > 
  > How exactly does this work? Let’s look at the three roles of user, issuer and verifier. Firstly, users can have any number of attributes – such as their credit rating, national identity document or driving licence – certified by the entity responsible for each attribute.

  > This article explains what a wallet is, how it works and how you can use it for managing your digital identity. While there are also wallets for institutions, this article only focuses on wallets for end users.

  > SSI and identity wallets will make it easier for citizens, organizations and governments to manage (digital) identities. It will make registrations and transactions across the internet private and secure. It will also make organizations more efficient and effective. As administration is reduced, costs will decrease. As their user interface becomes easier to use, their customers will perform more registrations with less errors - what in some cases will lead to extra revenue, but in all cases will lead to more satisfied customers

  > The EFF further has recommended W3C Verifiable Credentials due to their history of being developed in the public, and being an open standard. We agree with this. Vendors such as Microsoft, Ping Identity, Workday, and Spruce have already adopted these in pilots and production use cases. Furthermore, Underwriter Labs, an author of ISO 18013-5, has described how to [interoperate Verifiable Credentials with the ISO described data model](https://blog.spruceid.com/an-identity-wallet-bill-of-rights/) and protocols. We look forward to continuing our collaborations here such as demonstrating interoperability with TBD:

  > There's plenty of talk of super apps around at the moment as a variety of players attempt to become the western equivalent of the Asian app giants such as Alipay, Gojek and Kakao. But how do you get from a digital wallet to a super app?
* [The easiest tool to imagine is a wallet or a wallet app (here’s one) with some kind of dashboard](https://medium.com/global-id/the-gid-report-134-doj-challenges-visa-plaid-ssi-is-hot-stuff-f7811bdda7cd) 2020-11-11 [ [Sources](https://blogs.harvard.edu/vrm/2020/11/02/ssi-2/)]

  > Paper VC’s are hard to bring to parity with “digital VC’s”. The biggest issue is binding subject to holder and verifying that. There were also callouts on how do you prevent replication.
  > 
  > Traditionally, QR codes with the entire VC can be put onto a piece of paper. We proposed compression on those QR codes using CBOR-LD that reduces size of codes by 50%.
  > 
  > Alternative ways include adding VC’s into NFC chips and adding the NFC identifier as a claim to the VC preventing duplication. There is a cost overhead to this compared to paper but is a cost potentially worth occurring.

  > If an identity is tied to a single persistent private key, then loss or compromise of the private key will mean total loss of the identity. Since key compromise and/or loss do happen there needs to be a way to recover from this in order to have a persistent digital identity. [See here for definitions used](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rebooting-the-web-of-trust/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/shared_terminology_for_digital_identity_systems.md).
  > 
  > If the user of the identity suspects that a key is or may be compromised the user can rotate their key by submitting a new key to the system, signed by the old key. After this the old key can be revoked.

  > Skills-based practices make pathways to good careers more accessible to a wider segment of the workforce by focusing on what workers can do, not on the degrees or certifications they’ve earned. The verifiable credentials wallets highlighted in this market scan give learners and workers the tools they need to communicate the totality of their skills and abilities and translate their achievements into future opportunities\

  > We narrowed the field from hundreds of digital wallets to those that workers and learners can use to store and share their verifiable credentials.

The initial focus of the study was on the enterprise aspects of Digital Wallets but it quickly shifted and broadened to apply generally to people and organizations. The project is culminating in a public and private report. The public report is intended to start a deeper discussion into what we really need from our Digital Wallet.
