## General
* [Top 8 Identity Challenges After an Merger and Acquisition](https://www.radiantlogic.com/blog/top-8-identity-challenges-after-an-ma/) 2022-06-20 RadiantLogic
  > If you’re on the IT team, your headaches are just beginning as you’ll be responsible for integrating the new employees into your current tech and identity stack. You’ll be faced with multiple identity sources, a new identity governance and administration (IGA) solution to look at, various LDAP and Active Directory (AD) data sources to deal with, and several cloud applications that use various single sign-on (SSO) solutions to federate identity.
* [Seven Ways Self-Sovereign Identity Can Enable True Digital Transformation](https://www.evernym.com/blog/self-sovereign-identity-digital-transformation/) 2021-03-12 Evernym
  > “Self-Sovereign Identity not only presents an opportunity for businesses to build smarter, more secure, and more scalable relationships with customers; but it will enable them to completely rethink how they build trusted digital relationships from the ground up.”
  > 
  > We expect Digital Transformation to be a more prevalent talking point around digital identity. FOMO can go a long way, to sell SII, for Goverments and Corporations striving to not be left behind in the digital age.
* [Who Controls Your Digital Identity?](https://blogs.sap.com/2021/02/18/who-controls-your-digital-identity/) 2021-02-18 SAP
  > SSI will have to be integrated with large existing business processes – and therefore enterprise systems such as ERPs, HCMs, or SCMs to name a few. If this integration results in SSI being as easy to use as clicking a button or selecting a menu item, it will lead to rapid uptake and acceptance.
* [Just ask](https://werd.io/2021/just-ask) 2021 Werd
  > We’d get the startup founders to figure out the biggest assumptions they were making across user risk (do people want this?), business risk (can this be the center of a viable business?), and feasibility risk (can we build this in a scalable way with the time, team, and resources potentially at our disposal?). And then we’d ask them to go out and figure out how to de-risk those assumptions in the real world, usually by talking to experts and asking smart questions.

  > They quote [Forrester](https://www.forrester.com/report/New+Tech+Decentralized+Digital+Identity+DDID+Q1+2020/-/E-RES147115) “*Today’s digital identity frameworks are centralized, suffer from a lack of trust, aren’t portable, and don’t give consumers control.*”
  > 
  > They touch on a new acronym saying : enterprise-level thinking around next-generation authentication is focused on initiatives such as [SPIFFE](https://spiffe.io/), the Secure Production Identity Framework For Everyone

## Business Models
* [Why plastic cards are a model for verifiable credentials as a service](https://lockstep.com.au/magnetic-stripe-cards-and-verifiable-credentials/) 2022-08-16 Lockstep
  > The plastic card paradigm has some powerful features which are instructive for the emerging VCs-as-a-service industry.
  > - A competitive market of card personalisation bureaus, providing custom production, magnetic stripe encoding, and card distribution and activation, all in commercial bundles which can be purchased by government agencies, banks, professional associations, universities, driver licence bureaus, and so on. On the rear of many plastic cards, the card manufacturer is indicated in fine print. It may well be that the same manufacturer produced your credit cards and government cards.

* [Decentralized ID Management Business Value of SSI](https://www.inforisktoday.com/self-sovereign-identity-more-use-cases-a-16448) 2021-04-22 Heather Dahl, Ken Ebert Indicio
  > The decentralized workforce is also fueling demand for self-sovereign identity, Dahl says. "When you physically decentralize your workforce in society, the need for identity becomes more important." She says increasing concerns about protecting privacy are "pushing organizations to consider identity solutions that don't involve correlation and don't involve third-party tracking but also provide the security.”

  > Companies that support a Verifiable Credential Issuance standard can provide audited and truthful information to any third party on behalf of and with specific permission from their customers. For example, a bank could provide proof-of-funds in the form of a digitally verified credential document, that can then be used as a source of truth to instantly initiate a mortgage application, or a real estate purchase offer.

* [Where the Intention Economy Beats the Attention Economy](https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2021/10/04/where-intention/) 2021-10-04 Doc Searls
  > There’s an economic theory here: Free customers are more valuable than captive ones—to themselves, to the companies they deal with, and to the marketplace. If that’s true, [the intention economy](https://www.amazon.com/Intention-Economy-When-Customers-Charge/dp/1422158527) will prove it. If not, we’ll stay stuck in the attention economy, where the belief that captive customers are more valuable than free ones prevails.

  > IIW trying to imagine what’s the proven stuff for 5 years down the road, start designing it now. Bleeding edge of digital identity in some respects. Other pockets of the internet where you can find where the innovators are doing stuff. Most 95% of companies in Identity trying to get some enterprise(s) properly connected, wired up. Industry, IAM. Consider as two separate fields. Identity research, science - vs. Identity Operations. Most work in Identity is Identity Operations and Business practice.

## Marketing

  > Lead with key benefits. The release features two: support for diplex-matched antennas and faster workflow. The original headline mentions only the first, I added the second.
  > 
  > Clarify modifiers. A phrase like “diplex matched antennas” is ambiguous. Does “matched” modify “diplex” or “antennas”? The domain is unfamiliar to me, but I suspected it should be “diplex-matched” and a web search confirmed that hunch.
  > 
  > Omit needless words. The idea of faster workflow appears in the original first paragraph as “new efficiencies aimed at streamlining antenna design workflows and shortening design cycles.” That’s a long, complicated, yet vague way of saying “enables designers to work faster.”
