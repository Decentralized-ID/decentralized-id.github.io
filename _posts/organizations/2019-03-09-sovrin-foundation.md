## Sovrin Stewards

The Sovrin ledger is operated by Stewards, trusted organizations within the ecosystem who have agreed to abide by the requirements in the [Sovrin Trust Framework](https://sovrin.org/library/sovrin-governance-framework/) and are responsible for operation the nodes that maintain the Sovrin distributed ledger.

Stewards also, as a group, accept or reject any changes to the ledger-specific portions of the Sovrin open source code by virtue of that role. They thus provide a counterbalance to the Sovrin architects who maintain the Indy code base.
