## Background
* [Video] [Phil Windley on the Sovrin Network](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxQUL2ztFi8) 2017-09-08
  > Phil Windley, former CIO of the State of Utah and renowned expert on digital identity, speaks about his latest work as chairman of the Sovrin Foundation, a private-sector, international non-profit that was established to govern the world’s first self-sovereign identity (SSI) network.
* [Sovrin Foundation Releases World’s First Public Distributed Ledger for Self-Sovereign Identity](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2017/09/14/1121456/0/en/Sovrin-Foundation-Releases-World-s-First-Public-Distributed-Ledger-for-Self-Sovereign-Identity.html) 2017-09-14
  > The Sovrin Foundation announced the launch of the provisional Sovrin Network, the world's first truly self-sovereign digital identity system. The Sovrin Network operates on a distributed ledger -- technology sometimes referred to as a blockchain -- built from the ground up for this purpose.
* [A Universal Trust Framework](http://www.windley.com/archives/2017/01/a_universal_trust_framework.shtml) 2017-01 Phil Windley
  > The Internet has never had a universal trust framework before. Imagine if you could build the next sharing economy application without having to also build the platform that helps people trust. This post describes a universal trust framework that is open to all. Sovrin changes the world by providing a universal means of trusting.

  >  Online services and interactions are being held back by the lack of identity systems that have the same virtues as the Internet. This post describes what we can expect from an Internet for identity.
* [Inevitable Rise of Self-Sovereign Identity](https://sovrin.org/library/inevitable-rise-of-self-sovereign-identity/) 2016-08
  > Why Sovrin represents the solution to identity challenges. This whitepaper explains why the Internet does not currently have an identity layer and how the emergence of distributed ledger technology (DLT) finally makes one possible.
* [The Sovrin Network- Making Self-Sovereign Identity a Reality](https://vimeo.com/305420834) from [Sovrin Foundation](https://vimeo.com/sovrinfoundation).

### Literature

* [Sovrin: An Identity Metasystem for Self-Sovereign Identity](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fbloc.2021.626726/full) 2021-07-28 Phillip J. Windley
  > presents the architecture of an identity metasystem called the Sovrin Network that aims to improve the user experience, increase flexibility, and reduce overall costs while supporting better privacy and security. We discuss the problems of online identity on the modern internet, discuss the nature of digital relationships, explore the architectures of identity systems, and detail the combination of these concepts into a comprehensive metasystem for solving the problems of online identity.
* [A Comprehensive Evaluation of the Identity Management Utility Sovrin](https://dutchblockchaincoalition.org/assets/images/default/Blockchain-Sovrin-rapport.pdf) 2018-10-16 Dutch Blockchain Coalition
  > The Dutch Blockchain Coalition (DBC) considers that ‘reliable identification and authentication are basic conditions for virtually all applications of blockchain’[1]. However, currently most identity management solutions are under central governance. Examples can be found in most social media platforms such as Facebook and Google accounts. Additionally, this extends to real world examples, such as a passport or a driver’s license provided by government. Although these solutions seem to work in practice, there is an essential issue. Namely, the owner of the identity is not in control of his/her identity. For example, a social media platform may decide to remove an account based on its own policy, leaving the identity owner with a virtual gap in its existence. Additionally, identifiers (such as a passport) provide a lot of -arguably too much- information about the identity holder, even though only a single attribute (e.g. the date of birth) needs to be known. Indeed, identity owners are no longer in control of their identity when using centralized identity management solutions
* [A Conceptual Analysis on Sovrin](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/323144927_A_Conceptual_Analysis_on_Sovrin) 2018-01 Rieks Joosten, TNO
  > 'Sovrin' (aka Hyperledger INDY) is a global, decentralized identity network that claims to deliver the Internet’s missing identity layer, using (public permissioned) distributed ledger technology. In order to find out to what extent the thinking within TNO about a Self-Sovereign Identity Framework aligns with that of Sovrin, a limited conceptual analysis has been performed on the Sovrin documentation that was available in September 2017. The report has findings on terminology and definitions, the legal taxonomy used by Sovrin entities, agents/clients, subject identifiers, guardianship and consent receipts.
* [A First Look at Identity Management Schemes on the Blockchain](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.03294.pdf) 2018-01-10 Paul Dunphy, Fabien A. P. Petitcolas
  > The emergence of distributed ledger technology (DLT) based upon a blockchain data structure, has given rise to new approaches to identity management that aim to upend dominant approaches to providing and consuming digital identities. These new approaches to identity management (IdM) propose to enhance decentralisation, transparency and user control in transactions that involve identity information; but, given the historical challenge to design IdM, can these new DLTbased schemes deliver on their lofty goals? We introduce the emerging landscape of DLT-based IdM, and evaluate three representative proposals – uPort, ShoCard and Sovrin – using the analytic lens of a seminal framework that characterises the nature of successful IdM schemes

## [Sovrin Stewards](https://sovrin.org/stewards/)

> The Sovrin ledger is operated by Stewards, trusted organizations within the ecosystem who have agreed to abide by the requirements in the [Sovrin Trust Framework](https://sovrin.org/library/sovrin-governance-framework/) and are responsible for operation the nodes that maintain the Sovrin distributed ledger.
> 
> Stewards also, as a group, accept or reject any changes to the ledger-specific portions of the Sovrin open source code by virtue of that role. They thus provide a counterbalance to the Sovrin architects who maintain the Indy code base.
