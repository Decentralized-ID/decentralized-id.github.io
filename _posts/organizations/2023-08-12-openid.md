## Main

* [OpenID Foundation Publishes “Open Banking and Open Data: Ready to Cross Borders?”](https://openid.net/final-version-of-open-banking-and-open-data-ready-to-cross-borders-whitepaper-published/) 2023-02-06 OpenID
  > More than 50 open data, digital identity and API security technologists globally contributed to this whitepaper to answer the following questions:
  > 1. What are the differences and similarities between different open data ecosystems?
  > 2. Is global interoperability between different ecosystems possible?
  > 3. Who will be driving this movement and what are the use cases motivating them? How will users benefit?
  > 4. How could cross-border use cases work and what “good might look like”? What are the architecture and governance requirements?
  > 5. What can you do if you believe this is the right direction for Open Banking and Open Data?
* [OpenID Foundation Publishes “The Global Open Health Movement: Empowering People and Saving Lives by Unlocking Data” Whitepaper](https://www.openid.net/openid-foundation-publishes-the-global-open-health-movement-empowering-people-and-saving-lives-by-unlocking-data-whitepaper/) 2022-07-22 OpenID
  > The whitepaper offers an overview of the global health sector privacy and security landscape and introduces similar work from outside the health domain with health experts. One key hypothesis we will test is that existing Open Banking and other Open Data standards, like FAPI, could help the health community deliver on their Open Health goals more quickly.
* [OpenID for Verifiable Credentials](http://openid.net/wordpress-content/uploads/2022/05/OIDF-Whitepaper_OpenID-for-Verifiable-Credentials_FINAL_2022-05-12.pdf) 2022-05-12 OpenID
  > The goal of this whitepaper is to inform and educate the readers about the work on the OpenID for Verifiable Credentials (OpenID4VC) specifications family. It addresses use-cases referred to as Self-Sovereign Identity, Decentralized Identity, or User-Centric Identity.
* [OpenID Foundation Publishes Whitepaper on Open Banking](https://openid.net/2022/03/18/openid-foundation-publishes-whitepaper-on-open-banking/) 2022-03-18 OpenID
  > The OpenID Foundation is pleased to share its new whitepaper, “[Open Banking, Open Data and Financial-Grade APIs](https://openid.net/wordpress-content/uploads/2022/03/OIDF-Whitepaper_Open-Banking-Open-Data-and-Financial-Grade-APIs_2022-03-16.pdf)”. The paper documents the international movement towards Open Banking, Open Finance, and secure, consent driven access to all user data. It describes the OpenID Foundation and in particular the Financial-Grade API (FAPI) Working Group’s experience with Open Banking ecosystems internationally.
* [The 7 Laws of Identity Standards](https://openid.net/2021/04/10/the-7-laws-of-identity-standards/) 2021-04-10 OpenID
  > 1. A identity standard’s adoption is driven by its value of the reliability, repeatability and security of its implementations.
  > 2. A standard’s value can be measured by the number of instances of certified technical conformance extant in the market.
  > 3. Certified technical conformance is necessary but insufficient for global adoption.
  > 4. Adoption at scale requires widespread awareness, ongoing technical improvement and a open and authoritative reference source.
  > 5. When Libraries/Directories/ Registries act as authoritative sources they amplify awareness, extend adoption and promote certification.
  > 6. Certified technical conformance importantly complements legal compliance and together optimize interoperability.
  > 7. Interoperability enhances security, contains costs and drives profitability.

## Standards Development
* [Proof-of-possession (pop) AMR method added to OpenID Enhanced Authentication Profile spec](https://self-issued.info/?p=2198) 2021-10-13 Mike Jones
  > I’ve defined an Authentication Method Reference (AMR) value called “pop” to indicate that Proof-of-possession of a key was performed. Unlike the existing “hwk” (hardware key) and “swk” (software key) methods [...] Among other use cases, this AMR method is applicable whenever a [WebAuthn](https://www.w3.org/TR/2021/REC-webauthn-2-20210408/) or [FIDO](https://fidoalliance.org/specs/fido-v2.1-ps-20210615/fido-client-to-authenticator-protocol-v2.1-ps-20210615.html) authenticator are used.

### [Shared Signals Working Group](https://openid.net/wg/sharedsignals/)
> The Shared Signals working group is providing data sharing schemas, privacy recommendations and protocols to share security event information to thwart attackers from leveraging compromised accounts from one Service Provider to gain access to accounts on other Service Providers and enable users and providers to coordinate to securely restore accounts following a compromise.
* [OpenID RISC Profile Specification 1.0 - draft 02](https://openid.net/specs/openid-risc-profile-specification-1_0.html) 2022-04-05 OpenID
  > This document defines the Risk Incident Sharing and Coordination (RISC) Event Types based on the Shared Signals and Events (SSE) Framework. Event Types are introduced and defined in Security Event Token (SET).
* [Shared Signals: An Open Standard for Webhooks](https://openid.net/2021/08/24/shared-signals-an-open-standard-for-webhooks/) 2021-08-24 OpenID
  > The OpenID Foundation formed the “[Shared Signals and Events](https://openid.net/wg/sse/)” (SSE) Working Group as a combination of the previous OpenID RISC working group and an informal industry group that was focused on standardizing [Google’s CAEP proposal](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/re-thinking-federated-identity-with-the-continuous-access-evaluation-protocol). These represented two distinct applications of the same underlying mechanism of managing asynchronous streams of events. Therefore the [SSE Framework](https://openid.net/specs/openid-sse-framework-1_0-01.html) is now proposed to be a standard for managing such streams of events for any application, not just CAEP and RISC. In effect, it is a standard for generalized Webhooks.
* [Security Event Tokens, Subject Identifiers, and SSE/CAEP/RISC Java implementation](https://iiw.idcommons.net/13A/_Security_Event_Tokens,_Subject_Identifiers,_and_SSE/CAEP/RISC_Java_implementation) 2021-05-06 Matt Domsch
  > Matt presented an overview of the OpenID Foundation Shared Signals and Events Working Group, and his implementation of the object model in an open source Java library at [https://github.com/sailpoint-oss/openid-sse-model/](https://github.com/sailpoint-oss/openid-sse-model/)

## GAIN
* [How GAIN Happens, Slowly Then All at Once](https://openid.net/2022/06/03/how-gain-happens-slowly-then-all-at-once/) 2022-06-03 OpenID
  > GAIN is marked by a cross sector, crowd sourced, open, global due diligence. GAIN’s self organized participants are actively seeking evidence that disconfirms the GAIN hypothesis.
* [Protocols, Standards, Alliances: How to Re-GAIN the Future Internet from the Big Platforms](https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2022-panel-gain-future-internet) 2022-05-13 Kuppinger Cole
  > just like trade unions helped the working class during the industrial revolution to fight for their rights. In this panel session, we will discuss about the enablers of such a different approach and the requirements to actually be successfull.
* [Introducing the Global Assured Identity Network (GAIN) Proof of Concept Community Group](https://openid.net/2022/03/02/introducing-the-global-assured-identity-network-gain-proof-of-concept-community-group/) 2022-03-02 OpenID
  > The OpenID Foundation is pleased to announce the launch of the Global Assured Identity Network (GAIN) Proof of Concept Community Group, which aims to test the technical hypotheses underlying the [“GAIN Digital Trust”](https://gainforum.org/GAINWhitePaper.pdf) white paper.
* [Global Assured Identity Network White Paper](https://openid.net/2021/09/20/global-assured-identity-network-white-paper/) 2021-09-20 OpenID
  > The Global Assured Identity Network White Paper was the centerpiece of the OpenID Foundation’s  Chairman Nat Sakimura’s keynote at the European Identity Conference just a few days ago. His presentation can be found at https://nat.sakimura.org/2021/09/14/announcing-gain/. Nat describes GAIN as an overlay network on top of the Internet with all its participants identity proofed. One key benefit of the approach proposed in the white paper is that the standards required to enable this network already exist: OpenID Connect and eKYC/IDA.
  > 
  > The White Paper was a “no logo, pro bono, open source” collaboration of over 150 co-authors including many members of the OpenID Foundation. It’s well on its way to achieving its goal of generating a community wide discussion on the business, technical and legal requirements for pragmatic international interoperability.
* [EIC Speaker Spotlight: Nat Sakimura](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QG_gkZkpJwQ) 2021-08-24 Introducing Gain • OpenID Foundation
  > if you look at the the cost structure of the financial industry a lot of cost Is towards anti-money laundering and related activities and that actually is identity problem [...] we should try to solve the use case with a user centricity in mind
