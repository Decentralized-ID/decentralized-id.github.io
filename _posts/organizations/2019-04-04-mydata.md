## [My Data 2018 Presentations](https://mydata2018.org/presentations/)

### [Opening plenary](https://mydata2018.org/sessions/opening-plenary/)

Antti ‘Jogi’ Poikola (Main stage) – [[slides](http://okf.fi/main-stage-master)]

We have to embrace diversity to make MyData happen in large scale and to make it right. Businesses, legal experts, technologists and the societal thinkers are needed. MyData programme lead Antti ‘Jogi’ Poikola will help you to find your way to contribute in better digital future.

Viivi Lähteenoja – [[slides](http://okf.fi/opening-viivi)]
 
### [Legal landscape (video)](https://mydata2018.org/sessions/legal-landscape/)

>Technology develops so fast, that GDPR may already be outdated. Willem Debeuckelaere and Elizabeth Renieris explain what kind of regulation we need for the era of decentralised blockchain technologies and personal data ecosystems.
>
>We know about the content of EU General Data Protection Regulation, and other personal data related new regulations and policies. How the legal text turns into societal impact and what is the future with fast technological development? President of the Belgian Commission for the Protection of Privacy Willem Debeuckelaere shares his insights on the citizen empowerment and law enforcement. Elizabeth Renieris, Global Policy Counsel from Evernym will reflect the future connections of regulation in the era of decentralised blockchain technologies.

Elizabeth Renieris – [[slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wYR2v8UeCFAhf8g12gRniHzyK1Ze8oc1Hp1LW4qjGYs/edit#slide=id.g3ff288e1c8_0_90)] [[podcast](https://mydata.org/podcast/elizabeth-renieris/)]

In this presentation, I will argue that the “new” Regulation isn’t so new from at least three perspectives – historical, technological, or structural.

Willem Debeuckelaere – [[slides](http://okf.fi/opening-viivi)]

Empowering the citizen or explicit state law enforcement?

### [Make it happen (video)](https://mydata2018.org/sessions/make-it-happen/)

>In this session we will hear from the conference partners how they are making the new human centric personal data reality. The slogan for MyData conferences and the global community is “Make it happen, make it right”. The future practices around personal data management should become sustainable from business perspective as well as distinctively different and better from the “data economy as usual” (make it happen) and at the same time they should be sustainable from societal and individual perspectives (make it right). The part of making it happen is like pushing the gas pedal while making it right is like using the steering wheel and breaking when needed.

Kirsi Pulkamo – [[slides](http://www.rss.org.uk/data-manifesto)] [(video)](https://youtu.be/jl5OQb6FvRY)

Jaana Sinipuro – [[podcast]](https://mydata.org/podcast/jaana-sinipuro/)  [(video)](https://youtu.be/YhV9UuM-wG4)

### [Personal Data for Common Good](https://mydata2018.org/sessions/personal-data-for-common-good/)

Strong data protection and personal data for common good? These should not be contradicting goals. Jeni Tennison from Open Data Institute and Hetan Shah from the Royal Statistical Society will share experiences and outline some of the potential mechanisms available to ensure that data can be used for public good, in order to maintain trustworthiness, and public support for innovation.

>How to build a fairer data ecosystem -Jeni Tennison, Open Data Institute - [(video)](https://youtu.be/IVkqYHZe-cs)

>In this talk, Jeni will share a vision a future where people, organisations and communities use data to make better decisions and are protected from any of its harmful impacts. The talk will include lessons learned from building this vision so far, and ways that everyone can get involved in building the future.

>A Data Manifesto for the Common Good -Hetan Shah, Royal Statistical Society – [[slides](http://www.rss.org.uk/data-manifesto)] [(video)](https://youtu.be/CMwoxnWLpIk)

>Hetan will outline the thinking of the Royal Statistical Society’s Data Manifesto on how data can be used for the common good. He will talk about recent initiatives in the UK to promote data ethics, including the new Ada Lovelace Institute and the government Centre for Data Ethics. He will consider the options that exist to ensure that personal data can be used for public good and in particular on how to deal with the emergence of private sector data monopolie


### [The Domains of Identity (video)](https://mydata2018.org/sessions/the-domains-of-identity/)

>At the moment we are not in control of our digital identities as we have given them to giant companies like Facebook and Google – or governments. Kaliya Young, better known as Identity woman, explains how we, the people, could gain back our sovereignty and Tony Fish & Lubna Dajani describe what kind of tools we could have to do that.
>
>Discussions of personal data and identity management are often confusing because they mix issues from multiple domains, or because they try unsuccessfully to apply solutions from one domain to problems in another. Kaliya Young will outline the key domains of identity to bring clarity for the discussions in the MyData conference.

Kaliya Young – The Domains of Identity – [(video)](https://youtu.be/gfi11GZjbWM)

### [Future of Web](https://mydata2018.org/sessions/future-of-web/)

>Roughly 30 years of history of web has shown that many things did not turn out quite as imagined in the early days. What are the key questions for the next thirty years? Security & Privacy Expert Mikko Hyppönen from F-Secure will reflect the history of web, what kind of expectations there has been and why the development was not always as expected and how should we tune our expectations and actions towards the future.

Mikko Hypponen – [[slides](https://mydata2018.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/14/gravity_forms/19-eb584a27cf50606ce6d69843eecada2f/2018/08/hypponen_mydata2018.pptx)] [(video)](https://youtu.be/zwkDTKkafOc) [[podcast](https://mydata.org/podcast/mikko-hypponen/)]

### [Collective and Personal](https://mydata2018.org/sessions/collective-and-personal/)

>Much of personal data is fundamentally social in nature – it is not tied to one individual, but rather to many people. Data is also communication and signaling, it is shared between many. The collective production and use of data create technical and social challenges what may be missed in the discussions if we speak about human centric personal data purely in individualistic terms. Dawn Nafus from Intel Labs and Mad Price Ball from Open Humans Foundation dive deep in to the challenges and solutions of collective personal data.

Mad Ball – [[slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18-itUjpw9uRUISIwrF7dKeK2kDndXKS8Hr_RDJo1Oh8/edit?usp=sharing)] [(video)](https://youtu.be/MOT_fj4LP8Q)

Can we empower ourselves collectively – from individuals to communities? Vignettes from Open Humans and reflections on the power of peer production.

Dawn Nafus – [(video)](https://youtu.be/fhj07mgxpV0)

How can we empower ourselves around our personal data – and potentially contribute to a greater good?

### [My AI in the Peace Machine](https://mydata2018.org/sessions/my-ai-in-the-peace-machine/)

>Let’s allow computers listen and read all of our words, and use machine learning to lessen hate and fear. Peace Machine is a creation and legacy of professor Timo Honkela, a powerful concept of using AI in peace building.

Timo Honkela – My AI in the Peace Machine [[slides](https://mydata2018.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/14/gravity_forms/19-eb584a27cf50606ce6d69843eecada2f/2018/09/Timo_Honkela_MyData_31aug2018_v4.pdf)] [(video)](https://youtu.be/-0_RGI4Atf0)
 
### [Rebuilding the Digital Era](https://mydata2018.org/sessions/rebuilding-the-digital-era/)

>In this session Konstantinos Karachalios from IEEE and member of the European Parliament Marju Lauristin share insights on rebuilding the digital era trough standards and government policies. Providing a form of “soft regulation,” standards work because they provide best in class thinking through an open and democratic process and a collective consensus building effort. On the other hand also hard regulations is needed even if it takes longer time to make happen.

Konstantinos Karachalios – [[slides](https://mydata2018.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/14/gravity_forms/19-eb584a27cf50606ce6d69843eecada2f/2018/08/KK_My_Data_Keynote_FINAL_8.30.pptx)] [[podcast](https://mydata2018.org/speakers/konstantinos-karachalios/)]

>IEEE is the world’s largest technology association with over 420,000 members in more than 160 countries. The new standards projects are putting people at the center of their data. In the past year IEEE has launched several open Standards Working Groups focused on empowering individuals to access and control their personal data and identity. Depending on the degree of complexity, standards project may take a period of two to three years, at the end of which a document is produced and made available for engineers, companies or policy makers to utilize in their efforts.

Marju Lauristin – [[slides](https://mydata2018.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/14/gravity_forms/19-eb584a27cf50606ce6d69843eecada2f/2018/08/KK_My_Data_Keynote_FINAL_8.30.pptx) [(video)](https://mydata2018.org/speakers/konstantinos-karachalios/)


### [MyData the disruptor (video)](https://mydata2018.org/sessions/mydata-the-disruptor/)

>We are going through incredibly exciting and rapid societal, economic and technological change. Luukas Ilves will offer some strategies to carry the MyData agenda forward in discussions on economic policy and AI ethics.

Jaana Sinipuro (Main Stage) – [podcast](https://mydata.org/podcast/jaana-sinipuro/)
 
### [Closing Plenary](https://mydata2018.org/sessions/closing-plenary/)

>Linnet Taylor will summarise the most important findings of the conference in relation to the central themes of MyData, and to the overall aim of creating usable, fair and just systems for a datafied society.

Linnet Taylor (Closing Plenary) – [[slides](https://mydata2018.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/14/gravity_forms/19-eb584a27cf50606ce6d69843eecada2f/2018/08/Closing-plenary.pptx) [(video)](https://youtu.be/gIVdgh7DaCo)
 
### [Our Data Rights](https://mydata2018.org/sessions/our-data-rights/)

>Bring together three communities that are not talking to each other enough to chart a joint way forward: AI ethics, open data, privacy/surveillance. The outcome is a coming together, a silo busting, of these 3 groups around a joint data rights framework for individuals, companies and governments, which will then be translated into (1) campaigns, (2) regulations, (3) policy change.

Jeni Tennison (Main Stage) – [[slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18u7IZF5knegT92AZkEp-MKSt7Xfv3Tu-ymfiyeBn7pI)]

Strong data protection and personal data for common good? These should not be contradicting goals. Jeni Tennison from the ODI will outline some of the potential mechanisms available to ensure that data can be used for public good, to maintain trustworthiness and public support for innovation.

### [Practical AI ethics](https://mydata2018.org/sessions/practical-ai-ethics/)

>Recognizing that every Artificial Intelligence (AI) system has humans in the loop, we propose Human-in-the-loop Artificial Intelligence (HitAI) as a fairer paradigm for building AI systems. In fact, HitAI will reward the legitimate owners of the knowledge used in these systems. Any decisions of AI systems generating revenues will repay the legitimate owners of the knowledge used for taking those decisions. This is a call for AI reserchers! As modern Merry Men, HitAIresearchers should fight for a fairer Robin Hood Artificial Intelligence that gives back what it steals.

Fabio Massimo Zanzotto – [slides](https://mydata2018.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/14/gravity_forms/19-eb584a27cf50606ce6d69843eecada2f/2018/08/2018_MyData_Human-in-the-loop_new_version1.pptx) [(video)](https://youtu.be/QsJ1kS7Ojlo)


>Privacy is reborn in the digital age with the demand of data subjects on their rights. In AI research and development more attention is directed to building interpretable, anonymous, secure and fair AI systems. We will discuss the challenges and best practices of model interpretability, building anonymous models, data minimisation and anonymisation based on Erlin’s experience at Silo.AI on privacy by design principle and fair usage of AI.

Erlin Gulbenkoglu – [(video)](https://youtu.be/mPXX_pe0Zbk)]


>CHAOS architects is an AI SaaS company that brings a sustainable and holistic solution to smart city and urban planning challenges. Through data analysis and crowd insights, CHAOS architects creates favourable conditions for businesses and citizen initiatives. CHAOS AI Dashboard and CHAOS’ user interface Happycity allow citizens to share ideas about their cities and co-create together with the community.

### [Disruption](https://mydata2018.org/sessions/disruption/)

>**Life after the Death of GAFA** - Stuart Lacey, Trunomi
>
>GAFA have appealed to our most basic core instincts of our god (Google) our love (Facebook) our consumption (Amazon) and our vanity (Apple) – and have all lied to us: breaching privacy, intentionally breaking the law, avoiding taxes, eradicating jobs, destroying value.
>
>Although they pay fines for, apologise for and blatantly claim otherwise – they do so to solely gain shareholder value acting more like lords over serfs and destroying the middle class.
>
>At the root of all of this power play is OurData where we are the product. This session exposes the lies and corruption and explains the how, why and when of their imminent decline.
 
### [MyData kansallinen keruualusta (Finnish Language Session)](https://mydata2018.org/sessions/mydata-kansallinen-keruualusta-finnish-language-session/)

>We have collected population based Surveys for decades in Finland. Mostly by Statistics Finland and National Institute for Health and Welfare. Moreover, other public sector institutes need interaction platforms to get the data from citizens. In Finland the most of the data collection concerns the patients health records after the contact in social / healthcare. The possibilities to use new IoT gadgets on this platform is also possible.
>
>In the more recent projects like Suomi.fi, KanTa services and mostly in ODA-project Finland has created a platform that contacts population. In this project there is possible to enlarge the scope cross sectional. This is the basic idea to put under discussion. Is there a general need that could be fulfilled with this “National platform to collect citizens data”? Moreover could we give more personal view and ownership to us as a citizen. This also gathers the basic idea of Sitras new launch of IHAN.

### [Panel Session: Data Portability](https://mydata2018.org/sessions/panel-session-data-portability/)

>This session will start with a use case from Jim Groom, showing how data portability has been made possible across universities. Domain of One’s Own could provide also a powerful example in how higher education could harness application programming interfaces (APIs) to build a more user-empowered data ecosystem at universities.  This introduction talk will be followed by a panel discussion looking at issues affecting the adoption of data portability in other sectors, such as health and finance, with a particular focus on the motivations of businesses and individuals.

### [Technical aspects of Data Portability](https://mydata2018.org/sessions/technical-aspects-of-data-portability/)

Dataccess: portability by data-responsible organizations
Guillaume Jacquart, FING

During this talk we will highlight the results of Dataccess project, led by Fing and Orange, which goal was to provide a common framework for enabling personal data portability. It describes user experience of acting upon the portability right, and gives advice on technical and project lead.

Guillaume Jacquart – [slides](https://mydata2018.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/14/gravity_forms/19-eb584a27cf50606ce6d69843eecada2f/2018/08/20180829-MyData_Dataccess1.pdf)

### [Tools for data portability](https://mydata2018.org/sessions/tools-for-data-portability/)

>The session will showcase four open-source projects that focus on data portability. We will start investigating how new business models can leverage data portability and what tools and technologies can support that. Following this overview we will then conclude the session with lessons learned from real cases on how to build user friendly data portability tools and experiences. In particular we will learn about: 1) Ocean Protocol, which combines economic incentives with embedded privacy and security features to revolutionise the concept of data portability under individuals control; 2) “Personium”, a Personal Data Store (PDS) solution that aims to facilitate data portability; 3) Data Transfer Project, an open source project making it easy for individuals to copy data from one online service provider to another and 4) fair&smart, a platform which connects individuals to organisations and provide them with tools to share and manage personal data,

### [Wrestle the GDPR – and WIN!](https://mydata2018.org/sessions/wrestle-gdpr-and-win/)

>GDPR has presented challenges for many organisations – typically, knowing where to start in getting the data in their custody under control. There is not a one size fits all approach to complying. This session will explore the challenges that organisations face in understanding their data landscape and how they are attempting to meet the wider transparency needs of GDPR. Includes respect for the privacy of individuals’ personal data and their extended rights.
 
### [Interoperability and Decentralisation: Part I](https://mydata2018.org/sessions/interoperability-and-decentralization-part-i/)

>We give an overview of existing interoperability-focused standards and protocols useful to the MyData audience, covering their history, the classic centralized and federated approaches, and the new set of decentralized and self-sovereign ones. We’ll talk about where each approach is appropriate, how the various standards can interact, and what possible upgrade paths could be.
>

The end-to-end encrypted social network
Robert Guinness, Pondenome

>Pondenome was founded in March 2018, but the idea has been a long time in the making. Our goal is to launch an end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) social network by the end of 2018. Pondenome is aligned with MyData values and goals. We believe communication should be controlled by the people communicating, not the company sending around the messages.

### [Semantic Interoperability and Transparency](https://mydata2018.org/sessions/semantic-interoperability-and-transparency/)

>Harmonised semantics and standardised vocabularies for personal data are essential for portability, informed consent, notice and transparency of personal data processing. In this session will we will focus on how we can integrate semantic schemes in both subject-centric approaches and at the enterprise level. We will show how academia, industry and standards bodies are working together for regulatory compliance and the wider benefits of interoperability.

### [The Blue Ocean of Ethical Personal Data](https://mydata2018.org/sessions/the-blue-ocean-of-ethical-personal-data/)

>The dominant, so far widely successful, business models in the field of personal data are based on mass data collection, analysis and targeting advertisements. We have seen evidence that the public opinion is turning more negative towards such practices and the models are also being challenged by regulators. On this mature market also the competition is fierce. This session gathers investors to discuss and debate on the potential of creating blue ocean markets where the strict data protection is not a hindrance, but the key driver for businesses. This session looks at why and how personal data could be opened for wider ecosystems and what is the disruptive power of such networked innovation, and looks at this question from a corporate perspective.

### [Out from the silos – personal data for innovation](https://mydata2018.org/sessions/out-from-the-silos-personal-data-for-innovation/)

>Human-centric control of personal data underpins the seamless flow of data between different services and domains. Breaking data out of the silos enables new innovations that can emerge also outside of the domain of the original data provider, but still serve the common customer. As an example: the customer might be willing to use her loyalty card data in a health app, health is not the business of a retail chain, but by opening up for external innovators, the retail chain may be able to create more value for its customer who uses the loyalty card. This session looks at why and how personal data could be opened for wider ecosystems and what is the disruptive power of such networked innovation, and looks at this question from a corporate perspective.

### [Data and digital identity in the cities](https://mydata2018.org/sessions/data-and-digital-identity-in-the-cities/)

>The amount of data generated by human activity in cities is tremendous and is expected to grow every day. If for a long time cities (as authorities) were spectators rather than actors in terms of data use and management, this is no longer the case. Aware of the democratic, economic and ecological challenges related to this issue, many cities are embarking on projects for a more innovative usage and management of data generated by citizens. If these projects are at their starting stages, they are already projecting cities in a new era where they can aspire to a leading role on the (personal) data issue. During this session, we will discover some of these inspiring projects.

Sitra’s IHAN® project will create the missing building blocks for fair and functioning data economy. By creating an international protocol between end users, data providers and service providers we can enable a data ecosystem where everybody wins: service providers can start to create and capture value by providing relevant services to end users by using data from one or more data sources with the consent of the individual – giving people control over how and what their data is being used for.

### [Participatory exercise around data portability](https://mydata2018.org/sessions/participatory-exercise-around-data-portability/)

>We will start with a lightning talk presenting how GDPR’s Right for Data Portability has been implemented by service providers in the newspapers and journal industry. After setting the scene, the remaining part of the session will be ‘hands-on’ and interactive, involving participants into evaluating current tools usability, provide feedback and recommendation for the next generation of them in order to better fulfill end-users and not only service providers needs.

Crowdsourcing features of digi.nationallibrary.fi support also data portability. An export enables users to do research on materials also offline.
 
### [The imaginarium of MyData futures](https://mydata2018.org/sessions/the-imaginarium-of-mydata-futures/)

>We will tap into visions ranging from emerging technology projections to speculative fiction in our quest to explore wild, even provocative, future scenarios: paradoxical, fun, desirable, messy, failed, complicated, incoherent, and ordinary data futures. The goal is to somehow feel and get a grip of the MyData futures, and in the process, identify some of the challenges ahead.

>This strack will take the form of a single discussion on the possible futures of a MyData world, divided in two sessions: One focussed on emerging technologies, their future trajectories, and the impact on MyData futures; including the potential and challenges; And another that looks at life, society, and the economy in a MyData future.
