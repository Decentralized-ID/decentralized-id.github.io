  We are entrepreneurs, activists, academics, listed corporations, public agencies, and developers. For years, we’ve been using different words for what we do – MyData, Self Data, VRM (Vendor Relationship Management), Internet of Me, PIMS (Personal Information Management Services) etc, while sharing a common goal: to empower individuals with their personal data, thus helping them and their communities develop knowledge, make informed decisions, and interact more consciously and efficiently with each other as well as with organisations.

  > This white paper presents a framework, principles, and a model for a human-centric approach to the managing and processing of personal information. The approach – defined as MyData – is based on the right of individuals to access the data collected about them. The core idea is that individuals should be in control of their own data. The MyData approach aims at strengthening digital human rights while opening new opportunities for businesses to develop innovative personal data based services built on mutual trust

* [Opening plenary](https://mydata2018.org/sessions/opening-plenary/)Antti ‘Jogi’ Poikola (Main stage) [slides](http://okf.fi/main-stage-master)
  > We have to embrace diversity to make MyData happen in large scale and to make it right. Businesses, legal experts, technologists and the societal thinkers are needed. MyData programme lead Antti ‘Jogi’ Poikola will help you to find your way to contribute in better digital future.
* [Legal landscape (video)](https://mydata2018.org/sessions/legal-landscape/)
  > We know about the content of EU General Data Protection Regulation, and other personal data related new regulations and policies. How the legal text turns into societal impact and what is the future with fast technological development? President of the Belgian Commission for the Protection of Privacy Willem Debeuckelaere shares his insights on the citizen empowerment and law enforcement. Elizabeth Renieris, Global Policy Counsel from Evernym will reflect the future connections of regulation in the era of decentralised blockchain technologies.
* [The Domains of Identity (video)](https://mydata2018.org/sessions/the-domains-of-identity/) Kaliya Young [video](https://youtu.be/gfi11GZjbWM) 
  > Discussions of personal data and identity management are often confusing because they mix issues from multiple domains, or because they try unsuccessfully to apply solutions from one domain to problems in another. Kaliya Young will outline the key domains of identity to bring clarity for the discussions in the MyData conference.

{% include video id="gfi11GZjbWM" provider="youtube" %}
 
* [Our Data Rights](https://mydata2018.org/sessions/our-data-rights/)
  > Bring together three communities that are not talking to each other enough to chart a joint way forward: AI ethics, open data, privacy/surveillance. The outcome is a coming together, a silo busting, of these 3 groups around a joint data rights framework for individuals, companies and governments, which will then be translated into (1) campaigns, (2) regulations, (3) policy change.
* [Practical AI ethics](https://mydata2018.org/sessions/practical-ai-ethics/)
  > Recognizing that every Artificial Intelligence (AI) system has humans in the loop, we propose Human-in-the-loop Artificial Intelligence (HitAI) as a fairer paradigm for building AI systems. In fact, HitAI will reward the legitimate owners of the knowledge used in these systems. Any decisions of AI systems generating revenues will repay the legitimate owners of the knowledge used for taking those decisions. This is a call for AI reserchers! As modern Merry Men, HitAIresearchers should fight for a fairer Robin Hood Artificial Intelligence that gives back what it steals.
* [Showcases](https://mydata2018.org/sessions/showcases/)
  > This session will present latest advancements of MyData services from around the globe, with examples ranging from incubation of the data market to proof-of-concepts to revenue generating businesses. The presenters share key learnings and best practices for each phase, focusing on real scenarios, concrete data and key metrics derived from implemented business models.
* [Tools for data portability](https://mydata2018.org/sessions/tools-for-data-portability/)
  > In particular we will learn about: 1) Ocean Protocol, which combines economic incentives with embedded privacy and security features to revolutionise the concept of data portability under individuals control; 2) “Personium”, a Personal Data Store (PDS) solution that aims to facilitate data portability; 3) Data Transfer Project, an open source project making it easy for individuals to copy data from one online service provider to another and 4) fair&smart, a platform which connects individuals to organisations and provide them with tools to share and manage personal data,
* [Interoperability and Decentralisation: Part I](https://mydata2018.org/sessions/interoperability-and-decentralization-part-i/)
  > Categories of technologies include: Identity (e.g. DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials, Authentication (e.g. DID-Auth), Access Control, Aggregation and Federation (e.g. the new W3C ActivityPub and ActivityStreams2 specs), and Personal Data Store APIs (e.g. Solid).

  > There are lots of new and exciting developments going on in the decentralized & self-sovereign world of MyData. After offering a general overview to standards and protocols in the morning Part I session, this Part II will focus on concrete projects that are already underway. We will explore examples where decentralized technologies are being used, how they help interoperability, and how they integrate with existing infrastructure.

* [Semantic Interoperability and Transparency](https://mydata2018.org/sessions/semantic-interoperability-and-transparency/)
  > Harmonised semantics and standardised vocabularies for personal data are essential for portability, informed consent, notice and transparency of personal data processing. In this session will we will focus on how we can integrate semantic schemes in both subject-centric approaches and at the enterprise level. We will show how academia, industry and standards bodies are working together for regulatory compliance and the wider benefits of interoperability.
* [Standards for Delivering on the MyData Principles](https://mydata2018.org/sessions/standards-for-delivering-on-the-mydata-principles/)

    > Drummond will give an update on how we are making rapid progress on four emerging open standards for self-sovereign identity (SSI): DID (Decentralized Identifiers), DKMS (Decentralized Key Management System), DID Auth (how you authenticate using DIDs), and Verifiable Credentials (interoperable digital credentials), and how together these open standards are laying an SSI foundation for MyData.
* [The Blue Ocean of Ethical Personal Data](https://mydata2018.org/sessions/the-blue-ocean-of-ethical-personal-data/)
  > The dominant, so far widely successful, business models in the field of personal data are based on mass data collection, analysis and targeting advertisements. We have seen evidence that the public opinion is turning more negative towards such practices and the models are also being challenged by regulators. On this mature market also the competition is fierce. This session gathers investors to discuss and debate on the potential of creating blue ocean markets where the strict data protection is not a hindrance, but the key driver for businesses. This session looks at why and how personal data could be opened for wider ecosystems and what is the disruptive power of such networked innovation, and looks at this question from a corporate perspective.

* [Truly Global](https://mydata2018.org/sessions/truly-global/)
  > In this session we explore the MyData topics from the global perspective with experts from three international organisations IEEE Standards Association, World Bank and Open Knowledge International.
* [Dimensions of interoperability](https://mydata2018.org/sessions/dimensions-of-interoperability/)
  > We will start off the interoperability track with some of the most important topics of MyData interoperability. We will begin with how machines handling MyData understand interoperability. Then we will dive into the legal issues to be understood in interoperability, and finish with how interoperability can work at a national level in the X-Road architecture.
