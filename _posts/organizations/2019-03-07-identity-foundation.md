title: Decentralized Identity Foundation - DIF
excerpt: >
  A key piece of the decentralized identity equation is how people, organizations, and devices can be identified and located without centralized systems of identifiers (e.g. email addresses). DIF members are actively working on protocols and implementations that enable creation, resolution, and discovery of decentralized identifiers and names across decentralized systems, like blockchains and distributed ledgers.

* [Decentralized Identity Foundation](https://golden.com/wiki/Decentralized_Identity_Foundation) - golden.com
  >  The Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF) was founded in May 2017, and is an open source decentralized identity ecosystem for people, organizations, software applications, and devices. 

## Organization

* [DIF Organizational Materials](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/org) - GitHub
* [DIF Steering Committee Election Results 2022](https://blog.identity.foundation/sc-election-2022-results/)
  > SC Election results: DIF welcomes new SC members Sam Curren, Daniel Buchner, Karyl Fowler, Rouven Heck, Markus Sabadello & Kaliya Young!
* [Kaliya was elected to the DIF steering committee](https://blog.identity.foundation/sc-election-2022-results/) Decentralized Identity Foundation
  > The six elected candidates are Sam Curren (Indicio Tech), Daniel Buchner (Block), Karyl Fowler (Transmute), Rouven Heck (Consensys Mesh, Executive Director at DIF), Markus Sabadello (DanubeTech) & Kaliya Young (Identity Woman). Sam, Karyl, Markus and Rouven have been re-elected for another two year term as SC members. You can read more about the SC candidates' background and vision for DIF here.
* [Communication Milestone Achievements!](https://blog.identity.foundation/milestones/) DIF
  > This week, we hit 5k followers on Twitter, driven in no small part by attention garnered by our ToIP & DIF Joint Statement of Support for the Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) v1.0 specification becoming a W3C Standard. Currently, we stand at 5,011 followers and growing, and we are proud that our comms channels, namely our DIF blog, Twitter and YouTube channel, are a great way to keep on top of important announcements from DIF and our members. We have some exciting stuff cooked up for 2022, so watch this space! 🎉
* [Drilling down: Co-development](https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/drilling-down-co-development-in-the-open-765a86ab153f) DIF
  > - What “standardization” means to DIF and what DIF means to standardization.
  > - A newbie-friendly survey of how DIF relates to nearby organizations with overlapping or related foci.
  > - What “co-development” and “coöpetition” really mean, concretely
- [Finding the Bell Curve of Meaning](https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/finding-the-bell-curve-of-meaning-61a1d22b7bdd) Kaliya IdentityWoman
  > As such, we aimed to invite alignment around key words, to find the “bell curve of meaning,” and to invite convergence towards the middle of this curve as a result of our research process. Our hope was to maximize the ability to inform and engage business audiences interested in adopting/purchasing this technology. This meant we would not be setting out to define hundreds of terms; rather, we chose to focus on a subset of the most widely used terms.

## Grants
* [Introducing DIF Grants](https://blog.identity.foundation/introducing-dif-grants/) Decentralized Identity Foundation
  > DIF is kicking off a program to administer narrowly-scoped financial support for community initiatives, ranging in format from grants to more competitive implementation bounties, hackathon-style open collaborations, and security reviews.
* [DIF Grant #1: JWS Test Suite](https://blog.identity.foundation/dif-grant-1-jws-test-suite/)
  > DIF announces its first community microgrant, sponsored by Microsoft and rewarding the timely creation of a comprehensive test suite for detached-JWS signatures on Verifiable Credentials

## Interop
* [Setting Interoperability Targets](https://blog.identity.foundation/setting-interoperability-targets/) DIF
  > Our short-term roadmaps need testable, provable alignment goals that we can all agree on for our little communities and networks of technological thinking to converge gradually. Simply put, we need a few checkpoints and short-term goals, towards which we can all work together.
* [Setting Interoperability Targets Part 1 of 2](https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/setting-interoperability-targets-part-1-of-2-c6cbeaf82e98) DIF
  > The Interoperability working group will be tracking them and providing guidance and documentation where possible. Importantly, though, there is a new DIF Working Group coming soon, the Wallet Security WG, which will dive deeper into these profiles and requirements, benefiting from a narrow scope and IPR protection, allowing them to speak more bluntly about the above-mentioned details.
* [Setting Interoperability Targets Part 2 of 2](https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/setting-interoperability-targets-part-2-of-2-671f8faa8ecb) DIF
  > Having shown in our last piece how interoperability “profiles” are designed, we now tackle some key technical problem areas ripe for this kind of profile-first interoperability work across stacks.

  > We are keen to support more interoperability activity and hopefully testing this fall and winter. In order to do this we would like to gather feedback from the community as to where we are at so we can assess how to move forward.

  > - Replay attack protection
  > - Domain-specific identifiers and proofs
  > - New partial-disclosure topographies
