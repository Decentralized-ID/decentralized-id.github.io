title: Decentralized Identity Foundation - DIF
excerpt: >
  A key piece of the decentralized identity equation is how people, organizations, and devices can be identified and located without centralized systems of identifiers (e.g. email addresses). DIF members are actively working on protocols and implementations that enable creation, resolution, and discovery of decentralized identifiers and names across decentralized systems, like blockchains and distributed ledgers.

* [Communication Milestone Achievements!](https://blog.identity.foundation/milestones/) 2021-12-03 DIF
  > This week, we hit 5k followers on Twitter, driven in no small part by attention garnered by our ToIP & DIF Joint Statement of Support for the Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) v1.0 specification becoming a W3C Standard. Currently, we stand at 5,011 followers and growing, and we are proud that our comms channels, namely our DIF blog, Twitter and YouTube channel, are a great way to keep on top of important announcements from DIF and our members. We have some exciting stuff cooked up for 2022, so watch this space! 🎉

- [Finding the Bell Curve of Meaning](https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/finding-the-bell-curve-of-meaning-61a1d22b7bdd) 2020-07-17 Kaliya IdentityWoman, DIF
  > As such, we aimed to invite alignment around key words, to find the “bell curve of meaning,” and to invite convergence towards the middle of this curve as a result of our research process. Our hope was to maximize the ability to inform and engage business audiences interested in adopting/purchasing this technology. This meant we would not be setting out to define hundreds of terms; rather, we chose to focus on a subset of the most widely used terms.

## Interop
* [Interoperability Open Group](https://identity.foundation/interop/) DIF
  > Community collaboration and project management on Interoperability. Develop and publish definitions of success with respect to business interoperability, at the highest level. Defining points of protocol-defined touchpoints for maximum interchangeability of components at every layer; it is assumed that over time, that number will increase, not decrease. Community collaboration and project management on interoperability goal to seek the greatest interoperability in the greater good, not to pick winners. Provide feedback, input documents, members, and guidance to working groups producing standards, specifications, reference implementations and demonstrations hosted by community organizations including but not limited to IETF, W3C, W3C CCG, Hyperledger, Trust over IP.

  > The Interoperability working group will be tracking them and providing guidance and documentation where possible. Importantly, though, there is a new DIF Working Group coming soon, the Wallet Security WG, which will dive deeper into these profiles and requirements, benefiting from a narrow scope and IPR protection, allowing them to speak more bluntly about the above-mentioned details.

  > Our short-term roadmaps need testable, provable alignment goals that we can all agree on for our little communities and networks of technological thinking to converge gradually. Simply put, we need a few checkpoints and short-term goals, towards which we can all work together.

## Internet Identity Workshop

* [IIW32 - A wave of DIF donations and debuts](https://blog.identity.foundation/dif-monthly-18-may-2021/#iiw32a-wave-of-dif-donations-and-debuts) DIF Newsletter
* [Internet Identity Workshop #33](https://blog.identity.foundation/internet-identity-workshop-33/) DIF
  > Hundreds of attendees, including a number of DIF members, put together a huge programme of content for the 33rd IIW, covering topics ranging from the technical minutiae of IAM and SSI to big-picture discussions about ethics and strategy, and participated in over 110 virtual sessions across the three days.
