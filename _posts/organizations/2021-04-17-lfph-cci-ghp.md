  > Linux Foundation Public Health (LFPH) today announces the launch of the Global COVID Certificate Network (GCCN) to facilitate the safe and free movement of individuals globally during the COVID pandemic. GCCN will establish a global trust registry network that enables interoperable and trustworthy exchanges of COVID certificates among countries for safe reopening and provide related technology and guidance for implementation. The effort is initially supported by Affinidi, AOKPass, Blockchain Labs, Evernym, IBM, Indicio.Tech, LACChain, Lumedic, Proof Market and ThoughtWorks, who have implemented COVID certificate or pass systems for governments and industries. LFPH will work with them to define and implement GCCN. 
* [Introducing the Global COVID Certificate Network (GCCN)](https://www.lfph.io/2021/06/08/gccn/) 2021-06-08 LFPH
  > As more and more governments adopt [major COVID certificate standards](https://www.lfph.io/2021/10/12/global-covid-certificate-landscape/) to reopen borders, the travel industry is working hard to catch up on their technology to meet the evolving travel requirements. However, there is still no shortage of complaints from travelers about their cumbersome international travel experiences

  > MedCreds is a reference implementation of the Governance Framework and Use-Cases that have been developed in the CCI community.  
  > 
  > MedCreds is built on top of INDY and ARIES and is running on the SOVRIN Main Net. This is done through Trinsic (a third-party vendor)’s APIs. Trinsic agreed to document how to do this using the API’s on ARIES and devote an engineer to give instructions for how to use the open source code to run MedCreds.
  > 
  > MedCreds can be extended to support new credential schemas.

  > Indicio’s Cardea ecosystem easily integrates with existing applications, allowing people, businesses, healthcare systems, and governments to work together to safely reopen physical locations such as offices, restaurants, venues, schools, and travel, while complying with global health and data privacy laws. The ecosystem frees businesses, organizations, and governments from having to store and manage people’s private medical information. Instead, decentralized identity enables the individual to independently acquire and control their data and securely share or selectively disclose it at their discretion with full consent.

  > The CCI community collaborated with Linux Foundation Public Health to write a letter to the Biden Administration about how Verifiable Credentials could be used to support re-opening the economy.
  > 
  > "Some states and other countries have started to pilot this approach, as have various industries like film and aviation. But, the inconsistent use of standards and varying implementations have already led to confusion and public concern. An effort coordinated at the federal level would lead most quickly to uniform adoption and true inter-state and cross-domain interoperability."

  > 6. [Trust Registries](https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Trust+Registries+Drafting+Group) will specify how verifiers can confirm that a digital health pass has been issued by an authorized issuer.
  > 7. [Rules Engines](https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Rules+Engines+Drafting+Group) will define how digital health pass apps can access different sources of policy information to determine what test or vaccination status is needed for a specific usage scenario.
  > 8. [Identity Binding](https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Identity+Binding+Drafting+Group) will specify the options for verifying that the holder of a digital health pass is the individual who received the test or vaccination credential.
  > 9. [Governance Framework](https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Governance+Framework+Drafting+Group) will define the overall set of policies that must be followed for an implementation to qualify as Good Health Pass compliant.

## Covid Credentials Initiative (CCI)
> COVID-19 Credentials Initiative (CCI) is a part of Linux Foundation Public Health (LFPH), an initiative by Linux Foundation to build, secure, and sustain open-source software to help public health authorities (PHAs) combat COVID-19 and future epidemics. After initial success with deploying exposure notification apps, LFPH started to host CCI in December 2020 to advance the use of Verifiable Credentials (VCs) and data and technical interoperability of VCs in the public health realm, starting with vaccine credentials.

  > Solution assumption with the Good Health Pass is revoking is not necessary as VCs are short lived (solution to invalid credential). Issuers will re-issue vs. revoke
  > 
  > In many cases, labs are providing incorrect information in vaccination records, which need to be re-issued
  > - Still need to notify the holder that their (current VC) is invalid and they need to take action to resolve
  > - Issuers asking what if we make a mistake – (re-issue)
  > - Holders having problems findin there vaccination VC
  > - Many of the unresolved issues are governance/policy related (for which the “health authorities”) have not worked out the details
  > - Policy providers are applying the brakes through in-grained bureaucracy to produce a perfect standard for their jurisdiction vs. rapidly evolving a common standard and “usable solution” in the short term.
  > - Unclear on how to get VC and underlying data into the hands of holders, particularly as holders don’t have the technology and skills to manage their health data.
  > - Data privacy is an issue across each of the implementers and users of the Issuer, Holder and Verifier roles. Lack of common understanding and agreement on how and who owns and controls the data
  > - WHO standard will likely be adopted in the Global South (hemisphere)
  > - GHP looking to paint a forward looking common picture, including interim solutions (iterate standards)
  > - The number of players (and their levels of understanding/expertise and agreement with the current direction) alone makes consensus very difficult
  > - Paper credentials have been getting consensus on interim solutions.
  > - W3C and WHO are great candidates.

  > When the COVID-19 Credentials Initiative (CCI) was formed in April 2020, we were a self-organizing group of companies and individuals, held together by a few mailing lists and working groups, to explore how Verifiable Credentials (VCs), an open standard and an emerging technology, could be used for the public health crisis unfolding with COVID-19. Recognizing our limits early on as an informal group, we quickly pivoted from developing a solution together to supporting each other to build for their local contexts. Over the course of nine months, we have seen over 20 projects present their work to the CCI community and developed an MVP governance framework that can be adapted to specific COVID-19 use cases.

  > The COVID-19 pandemic has, in a few months’ time, taken the lives of almost half a million people worldwide and brought economies into lockdown globally. While many are struggling with the effects of social distancing, financial distress, or fear of contracting the virus, here at the COVID-19 Credentials Initiative (CCI), nearly 300 individuals from 100 organizations have united around a cause worthy of our collective efforts: supporting projects that deploy privacy-preserving Verifiable Credentials (VCs) to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 and strengthen our societies and economies.

  > We are all painfully aware of the economic and social restrictions imparted on us as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In order to reopen offices, restaurants, local private and public facilities — and most importantly, international borders — will likely require a flexible, interoperable, and ubiquitous system that preserves individual agency and privacy. The COVID-19 Credentials Initiative (CCI) focuses its efforts on supporting technology projects that work to meet these requirements through the utilization of W3C compliant ‘Verifiable Credentials (VCs)’, a tamper-evident credential that has authorship that can be cryptographically verified.

The aim is to, from two participants’ point of view, share an abbreviated case study of CCI and to highlight key challenges that arose in our efforts to responsibly use new privacy-preserving technologies to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. We wanted to share our submission with the CCI community and the public in the hope to invite some further discussions.

  > Before responding to the questions, we want to point out that the use of the term “COVID-19 passports” is questionable as the word ‘passport’ is used for the identity and travel document issued by nation states to their citizens. Another reason to question the use of ‘passport’ is the fact that our passport data is stored or centralized by the nation state issuer. Centralized systems are notorious and can be a source of potential  data breaches and abuses.
