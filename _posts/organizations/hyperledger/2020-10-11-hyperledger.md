excerpt: >
  Hyperledger began in 2015 when many different companies interested in blockchain technology realized they could achieve more by working together than by working separately.
   
  These firms decided to pool their resources and create open-source blockchain technology that anyone could use. These far-sighted companies are helping blockchain to become a more popular and industry-standard technology.

  > Hyperledger was put under the guardianship of the Linux Foundation (for a host of reasons that we’ll talk about later) and has grown rapidly in the last few years.
  > 
  > As of publication date, Hyperledger has more than 230 organizations as members—from Airbus to VMware—as well as 10 projects with 3.6 million lines of code, 10 active working groups, and close to 28,000 participants who have come to 110+ meetups around the world. Through 2017, the project was mentioned in the press an average of 1,500 times a month.

  > From the sidelines of the enterprise blockchain world, it looks like a tug-of-war has broken out, with IBM and its favored Hyperledger implementation, known as Fabric, on the one side, and the Intel-backed Sawtooth on the other. The latter team also has a budding champion in the form of newly appointed TSC chair, and Sawtooth lead maintainer, Dan Middleton of Intel.

  > Hyperledger Blockchain Consortium is growing to new heights with two software giants, Microsoft and Salesforce, coming aboard. It is a big move for blockchain, but also for the enterprises buying in.

  > For Hyperledger, a project of The Linux Foundation that started less than three years ago, the event is a time to reflect on milestones. Hyperledger has surpassed 260 members, with more than a dozen new members including Citi and Alibaba Cloud announced today. In the last year, Hyperledger launched its 11th project, Ursa, and released development updates to the Hyperledger Burrow, Hyperledger Fabric and Sawtooth frameworks. Additionally, Hyperledger and the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance jointly announced membership in each other’s communities as a way to further bolster enterprise blockchain adoption.

  > Much more can be done. For example, in the identity area, the Fabric team has developed an attribute-based identity verification mechanism called Identity Mixer that uses zero-knowledge proofs to demonstrate possession of digital signatures and private keys. Using this technology, Mixer allows you to prove you can do something without revealing who you are. On the other hand, if the goal is identity masking without attribute claims, the Ethereum community has been using a much simpler technique called Hierarchical Deterministic Wallet (HD-Wallet), which originated in the Bitcoin community so that you never reuse a digital identifier more than once. This eliminates any ability to correlate transactions over time, while all private keys are derived from a single root secret.\
  > [...]\
  > On the identity front, ideally the identities of an organization would not need to be re-built from scratch each time it joins a new consortium. Using a common decentralized identity system, whether it’s based on Hyperledger Indy or Ethereum uPort, or even based on links to legacy federated SSO systems such as ActiveDirectory or LDAP, makes this possible. Certainly more work is required to make this a reality.
