title: "Hyperledger Indy Resources" 
description: "A growing collection of educational resources related to Hyperledger Indy, the Sovrin Foundation, and Evernym."
excerpt: >
  Hyperledger Indy provides tools, libraries, and reusable components for providing digital identities rooted on blockchains or other distributed ledgers so that they are interoperable across administrative domains, applications, and any other silo. Indy is interoperable with other blockchains or can be used standalone powering the decentralization of identity.

* [Hyperledger Indy - *Distributed Ledger and Utility Library*](https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/hyperledger-indy) [[Twitter](https://twitter.com/Hyperledger)] [[Chat](https://chat.hyperledger.org)] [[Forum](https://forum.sovrin.org)]
* [Indy - wiki.hyperledger.org](https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/indy)
  * [indy.readthedocs.io](https://indy.readthedocs.io/) (under construction)
* [hyperledger/indy-node](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node)
  > This codebase embodies all the functionality to run nodes (validators and/or observers) that provide a self-sovereign identity ecosystem on top of a distributed ledger. It is the core project for Indy; over time, all other indy-* projects may collapse into this one, except for indy-sdk.
* [hyperledger/indy-sdk](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk)
  > This is the official SDK for Hyperledger Indy, which provides a distributed-ledger-based foundation for self-sovereign identity. Indy provides a software ecosystem for private, secure, and powerful identity, and the Indy SDK enables clients for it. The major artifact of the SDK is a C-callable library; there are also convenience wrappers for various programming languages and Indy CLI tool.

  > Credential issuers, holders, and verifiers are peers on an SSI network. Any person or organization can play any or all of the roles, creating a decentralized system for the exchange of trustworthy, digital credentials.
  > 
  > - Credential issuers determine what credentials to issue, what the credential means, and how they’ll validate the information they put in the credential.
  > - Credential holders determine what credentials they need and which they’ll employ in workflows to prove things about themselves.
  > - Credential verifiers determine what credentials to accept, and which issuers to trust.

  > Forrester’s recent “[Top Recommendations for Your Security Program, 2019](https://www.forrester.com/report/Top+Recommendations+For+Your+Security+Program+2019/-/E-RES151535),” testifies to this, describing SSI as a “win” for customers and businesses, and urged chief information security officers  (CISO) to “Empower your customers to control their own identities via self-sovereign identity.”
  > 
  > They can do this because exchanging verifiable digital credentials is at the heart of SSI. This ends the need for massive data silos, honeypots, and unsecured data repositories housed at countless corporations and organizations. Instead, anyone can hold secure and verifiable information about themselves

We also use zero-knowledge proofs in the revocation protocol, which is based on [cryptographic accumulators](https://eprint.iacr.org/2008/539.pdf).

### Prior Work
* [How is IDEMix Implemented?](https://forum.sovrin.org/t/how-idemex-is-implemented-in-sovrin-indy/)
  > Identity Mixer is not directly (re)implemented by Sovrin, but its cryptographic foundations are very similar, and Sovrin’s implementation includes most of its extended features (predicates, multi-credential, revocation, advanced issuance…). One of the researchers who helped to create Identity Mixer is on Sovrin’s Technical Governance Board and has offered insight to keep the implementations aligned on goals and methods.
