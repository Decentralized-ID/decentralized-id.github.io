The pilot leverages cryptography, blockchain technology and biometrics and aims to allow cross-border travel without presenting physical documents, accelerating the flow of passengers through airports, improving passenger experience, and enabling authorities to better focus limited resources on security improvements.

  > Much more can be done. For example, in the identity area, the Fabric team has developed an attribute-based identity verification mechanism called Identity Mixer that uses zero-knowledge proofs to demonstrate possession of digital signatures and private keys. Using this technology, Mixer allows you to prove you can do something without revealing who you are. On the other hand, if the goal is identity masking without attribute claims, the Ethereum community has been using a much simpler technique called Hierarchical Deterministic Wallet (HD-Wallet), which originated in the Bitcoin community so that you never reuse a digital identifier more than once. This eliminates any ability to correlate transactions over time, while all private keys are derived from a single root secret.\

  > On the identity front, ideally the identities of an organization would not need to be re-built from scratch each time it joins a new consortium. Using a common decentralized identity system, whether it’s based on Hyperledger Indy or Ethereum uPort, or even based on links to legacy federated SSO systems such as ActiveDirectory or LDAP, makes this possible. Certainly more work is required to make this a reality.

  > The farmer’s identifier is then recorded on the blockchain, which acts as an index with links to all applicable data—including things like their payment details so they can receive tips or add attestation that prove their farm’s inspection history and certification status (organic, etc.). This makes it easy to locate, access and share information without the farmer’s personal data being stored on the blockchain.  
  > 
  > The app on the farmer’s phone is multi-factored and authentication-secured; it allows the farmer to generate their own set of public and private keys seamlessly which the farmer can then use to sign data they send to others.
