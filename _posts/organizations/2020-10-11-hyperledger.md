description: Those of us involved with Hyperledger think the future of blockchain will involve modular, open-source platforms that are easy to use.
excerpt: >
  Hyperledger began in 2015 when many different companies interested in blockchain technology realized they could achieve more by working together than by working separately.
   
  These firms decided to pool their resources and create open-source blockchain technology that anyone could use. These far-sighted companies are helping blockchain to become a more popular and industry-standard technology.

  > Hyperledger began in 2015 when many different companies interested in blockchain technology realized they could achieve more by working together than by working separately.
  > 
  > These firms decided to pool their resources and create open-source blockchain technology that anyone could use. These far-sighted companies are helping blockchain to become a more popular and industry-standard technology. 
  > 
  > Hyperledger was put under the guardianship of the Linux Foundation (for a host of reasons that we’ll talk about later) and has grown rapidly in the last few years.
  > 
  > As of publication date, Hyperledger has more than 230 organizations as members—from Airbus to VMware—as well as 10 projects with 3.6 million lines of code, 10 active working groups, and close to 28,000 participants who have come to 110+ meetups around the world. Through 2017, the project was mentioned in the press an average of 1,500 times a month.

* [DEON](https://www.hyperledger.org/blog/2020/11/05/deon-a-hyperledger-based-decentralized-off-grid-network) 2020-11-05 
  > DEON is a new Hyperledger project focused in off-line communication networks, independent of internet infrastructure. This could be used to enable networks of devices to communicate peer-to-peer (without the need to ‘phone home’ over the internet), inter-enterprise consortia networks, and enabling user-centric data sharing in a more secure and private fashion.

### Ecosystem
* [Tensions Emerge Between Hyperledger Blockchain Group’s Biggest Supporters](https://www.coindesk.com/tensions-emerge-between-hyperledger-blockchains-biggest-supporters) 2022-12-11 Coindesk
  > From the sidelines of the enterprise blockchain world, it looks like a tug-of-war has broken out, with IBM and its favored Hyperledger implementation, known as Fabric, on the one side, and the Intel-backed Sawtooth on the other. The latter team also has a budding champion in the form of newly appointed TSC chair, and Sawtooth lead maintainer, Dan Middleton of Intel.

  > Declaring that blockchain has “gone mainstream,” Forbes today released its 2021 “Blockchain 50,” featuring companies that have at least $1 billion in revenues or are valued at $1 billion or more and “lead in employing distributed ledger technology.” And, once again, half of the companies on the list are using Hyperledger technology.

  > Hyperledger Blockchain Consortium is growing to new heights with two software giants, Microsoft and Salesforce, coming aboard. It is a big move for blockchain, but also for the enterprises buying in.

  > Much more can be done. For example, in the identity area, the Fabric team has developed an attribute-based identity verification mechanism called Identity Mixer that uses zero-knowledge proofs to demonstrate possession of digital signatures and private keys. Using this technology, Mixer allows you to prove you can do something without revealing who you are. On the other hand, if the goal is identity masking without attribute claims, the Ethereum community has been using a much simpler technique called Hierarchical Deterministic Wallet (HD-Wallet), which originated in the Bitcoin community so that you never reuse a digital identifier more than once. This eliminates any ability to correlate transactions over time, while all private keys are derived from a single root secret.\
  > [...]\
  > On the identity front, ideally the identities of an organization would not need to be re-built from scratch each time it joins a new consortium. Using a common decentralized identity system, whether it’s based on Hyperledger Indy or Ethereum uPort, or even based on links to legacy federated SSO systems such as ActiveDirectory or LDAP, makes this possible. Certainly more work is required to make this a reality.

## Hyperledger Identity

* [Introduction to Hyperledger Self-Sovereign Identity Blockchain Solutions (LFS172x)](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/training/introduction-to-hyperledger-sovereign-identity-blockchain-solutions-indy-aries-and-ursa/) Linux Foundation
  > Learn how Hyperledger Aries, Indy, AnonCreds, and Ursa add a necessary layer of trust to the Internet, creating and using independent digital identities rooted on blockchains or other distributed ledgers in this free course.
* [Investing in Verifiable Credentials, Technical Interoperability and Open Source](https://www.hyperledger.org/blog/2022/08/23/investing-in-verifiable-credentials-technical-interoperability-and-open-source) 2022-08-23 Hyperledger
  > As our approach evolves, we also remain keen to support open source solutions that interoperate with other national and international efforts. There is no dominant design yet, no one network or technology, so we must remain nimble and flexible in our exploration. We also need to coexist with existing identity solutions that millions of British Columbians already rely upon.

  > To understand why DLT is useful for identity, we need to go back to the basics—paper credentials, how that model has worked for 1000s of years, and how the use of DLTs with verifiable credentials allows us to transition the great parts—security and privacy—of that model to the digital age.

  > Michael Casey and Sheila Warren talk to Hyperledger Executive Director Brian Behlendorf about self-sovereign identity, the topic of this week's column. A developer whose three-decade career has seen him deeply involved in efforts to foster a more open internet, Brian grasps, like few others, the nuances of how human beings should live within a rapidly changing digital economy.

### Hyperledger Identity Special Interest Group
* [Identity Special Interest Group](https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/IWG/Identity+Special+Interest+Group) Hyperledger
  > The purpose of the Identity Special Interest Group is to discuss, research, and document ways to capture, store, transmit and use Identities on the DLT, specifically for the projects in the Hyperledger greenhouse. The Identities can be of nodes that participate in the running of the DLT or entities that transact on the DLT.
* [Get involved in the open source community](https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/IWG/Identity+Implementers+WG+Call) 2023-06-06
    > The Hyperledger Identity Implementers Working Group reviews project statuses and coordinates dependencies between a several different working groups building Self-Sovereign Identity technologies.  Invited guest presenters also provide introductions and insights into their SSI solutions.
* [Identity Standards](https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/IWG/Identity+Standards) 2019-03-20
  > We hope to accumulate links here that talk to all Identity Standards work. Short updates form this will be used in the paper.

  > We developed TrustID to ease the management of identities for the case of TrustOS. Users shouldn’t need to hold a different set of credentials for each network or decentralized application they interact with. The same credentials used to access your owned Bitcoins and manage your tokens in Ethereum should let you update the state of a Fabric asset or launch a secondary market in TrustOS.
