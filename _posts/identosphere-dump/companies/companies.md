Instead, X-Road is technically decentralized, but an X-Road ecosystem is always built around a centralized governance model managed by the X-Road operator.

For the realisation of the three projects, Self-Sovereign Identity will be a quintessential technology. A decentralised identity is supposed to allow users more self-determination in regards to identity data by putting the user in charge of the storage and transfer of their data. The data is only stored in a so-called wallet which belongs to the user. The wallet also contains digital keys for the authentication with services – making individual profiles for each service obsolete. State-of-the-art Blockchain technology ensures the reliability of the used data. Vereign AG, the head of the consortium, has been working with and on this technology for quite a while already. DAASI International will lend their expertise in the development of innovative open source software, as well as in classic identity management authentication technologies, and help with the development and overall realisation of the project.

## Big News this week Outh0 was acquired by Okta!
* [Okta + Auth0: Powering Identity for the Internet](https://www.okta.com/blog/2021/03/okta-auth0-powering-identity-for-the-internet/)

Today, we're taking a significant step forward — I'd go so far to call it a "leap" — to enhance the Okta Identity Cloud. We announced our agreement to join forces with Auth0, a leading identity platform for developers.

* [Okta Signs Definitive Agreement to Acquire Auth0](https://auth0.com/blog/okta-auth0-announcement/)

Auth0 will operate as an independent unit inside of Okta, and both platforms will be supported and invested in. As a result, organizations will have a wider breadth of identity solutions to fit their unique needs. Okta and Auth0’s comprehensive, complementary identity platforms are robust enough to serve the world’s largest organizations and flexible enough to address every identity use case, regardless of the audience or user.

### Kuppinger Cole Comment: [Okta & Auth0](https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/tolbert/okta-auth0)

The sunk cost of centralized databases is not an obstacle to decentralization. Verifiable credentials can be easily layered onto existing systems for better security. They can be used as a tool for orchestrating complexities across multiple identity management systems and databases so that they become privacy preserving and fraud resistant.

“We want to use verifiable credentials as a way of identifying and proving identity, which is different from the current Aave model, for instance,” Lobban said. “Verifiable credentials are interesting because they can introduce the scale that you need to provide access to these pools without necessarily having to maintain a white list of addresses. Since verifiable credentials are not held on-chain, you don’t have the same overhead involved with writing this kind of information to blockchain, paying for [gas fees](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-are-ethereum-gas-fees/), etc.”

Gitcoin isn’t the only project trying to solve decentralized identification (DID), but it does have a leg-up on the so-called “cold start” problem, Owocki said.

“What everyone else is missing is usage.” Today there are few if any dApps using DID, thus few users care about having an effective DID system, and decentralized apps have no incentive to prioritize it.
