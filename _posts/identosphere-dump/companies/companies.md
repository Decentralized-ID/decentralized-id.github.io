For the realisation of the three projects, Self-Sovereign Identity will be a quintessential technology. A decentralised identity is supposed to allow users more self-determination in regards to identity data by putting the user in charge of the storage and transfer of their data. The data is only stored in a so-called wallet which belongs to the user. The wallet also contains digital keys for the authentication with services – making individual profiles for each service obsolete. State-of-the-art Blockchain technology ensures the reliability of the used data. Vereign AG, the head of the consortium, has been working with and on this technology for quite a while already. DAASI International will lend their expertise in the development of innovative open source software, as well as in classic identity management authentication technologies, and help with the development and overall realisation of the project.
