When we [first launched the GlobaliD Wallet](https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-app-introducing-the-wallet-87870843dc1b) powered by Uphold back in June of 2020, the goal was clear. Our vision has always been that anyone, anywhere should be able to create and own their [self-sovereign digital identity](https://medium.com/global-id/why-self-sovereign-identity-matters-8fd2c982ca2e). And along with that identity, they should get a wallet, providing them access to basic financial services.
