* [Introducing Trinsic Ecosystems](https://trinsic.id/introducing-trinsic-ecosystems/)
  > Once an ecosystem is configured, providers need to onboard participants like issuers and verifiers. Trinsic Ecosystems comes with an API that’s extremely easy for any issuer or verifier to integrate and can be white-labeled with the name of the provider. In addition to the API, ecosystem participants can use the Trinsic Studio, a white-labeled web dashboard.

* [Trinsic Community Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/trinsiccommunity/shared_invite/zt-liwrvejk-dXC3uwYL6CCP~~RNIzc7sg)
  > As Trinsic has grown in popularity among the SSI developer community, several Trinsic User Groups have started organically. While we encourage this, we also want to give these communities an official home. That’s why we’ve created a Slack workspace just for the Trinsic community.
* [Company Culture & Trinsineers](https://trinsic.id/on-company-culture-trinsineers/)
  > Trinsineers are people who’ve agreed to take the journey to make the world more accessible to people everywhere. We’re a team of people who happen to be working together inside a legal entity called Trinsic. This journey is not a casual stroll, but an expedition. As Trinsineers, we’re developing a culture that is not only helping us accomplish our goals but bringing fulfillment and enjoyment along the way.

* [How to Create Connections in Trinsic Studio](https://trinsic.id/how-to-create-connections-in-trinsic-studio/)
  > In this blog post, we will explain how to create connections in Trinsic Studio. Throughout the steps below, we will be referring to a fictitious person, Alice Smith, who is a recent graduate of Faber College and is applying for a job. Alice has already received her digital diploma in the form of a verifiable credential and is wanting to apply to work for a company called ACME Corp. In order to start the online job application, Alice must first make a connection with ACME Corp.


* [Trinsic partners with Zapier to bring SSI to 2000+ applications](https://trinsic.id/trinsic-and-zapier-partner/). Including MedCreds which is part of the Covid Credentials Initiative.

Trinsic has released some [tools to issue verifiable credentials](https://trinsic.id/how-to-issue-credentials-in-trinsic-studio/).

> All verifiable credentials come from credential templates. These templates specify what information should be included in a credential. Faber College would most likely want the credential template of its digital diplomas to include a graduate’s first and last name, what they got their degree in, what year they graduated, and thier GPA. Let’s begin!

* [Trinsic just raised $8.5M 🎉 and we want to celebrate with you!](https://trinsic.id/trinsic-raises-8-5m-for-decentralized-identity-platform/)

developers face a dizzying number of standards to be compatible with—“[SoulBound Tokens](https://nftnow.com/guides/soulbound-tokens-sbts-meet-the-tokens-that-may-change-your-life/)” and [“Web5](https://twitter.com/jack/status/1535314738078486533)” being the latest additions to the litany of W3C, ISO, DIF, ToIP, and other existing specs. Trinsic offers teams a single API that acts as an abstraction layer that bridges ecosystems, strips complexity away from the development process, and ensures products are future-proof.

* [Building Digital Trust Ecosystems with Riley Hughes from Trinsic [Podcast]](https://northernblock.io/building-digital-trust-ecosystems/)
  > The reason I love that quote is that digital credentials and verifiable data can not only impact the use cases that everybody tends to think about when they think about SSI, but they could permeate our whole lives and streamline everything we do.
