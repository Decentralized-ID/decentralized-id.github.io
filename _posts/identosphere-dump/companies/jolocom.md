Our consultant focus is of course on decentralized digital identity (aka Self Sovereign Identity). Our advantage is that Jolocom has been able to build up enormous know-how through projects over the past 7 years. Not only was knowledge in the technology area built up, but also an extensive network through active work in committees (e.g. W3C, DIF, INATBA, ESIF / EBSI), associations (e.g. federal bloc) and consortia (e.g. shop window projects digital identities).

The starting point is the fact that every user has 70 digital identities online. Why not introduce one single secure digital ID solution to merge all of those identities? ID-Ideal is one way of many, offering an integrated solution or a middle way so that many identities can be supplemented by a single, secure digital ID solution.
