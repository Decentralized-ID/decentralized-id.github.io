# Mattr

* [MATTR has a series of Videos about their work with IATA](https://mattr.global/solutions/iata/)
  > This is a significant undertaking for both IATA and the other parties involved. As part of MATTR’s role in supporting this initiative, we developed a series of educational videos in partnership with IATA to explain the value and mechanics of a decentralised identity ecosystem.
* [Why we’re launching MATTR VII](https://medium.com/mattr-global/launching-mattr-vii-4e11bcb9aaef)
  > Inspired by the [seven states of matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_matter), our platform gives builders and developers all the tools they need at their fingertips to create a whole new universe of decentralized products and applications. We provide all the raw technical building blocks to allow you to create exactly what you have in mind. MATTR VII is composable and configurable to fit your needs, whether you’re a well-established business with legacy systems or a start-up looking to build the next best thing in digital privacy. Best of all, MATTR VII is use-case-agnostic, meaning we’ve baked minimal dependencies into our products so you can use them the way that makes the most sense for you.
* [ARUCC is pleased to announce a partnership between Digitary, its service partner, and MATTR, a friend of MyCreds™](https://mycreds.ca/2021/04/14/bridging-today-and-tomorrow-ensuring-self-sovereignty-for-learners-through-aruccs-mycreds/).

These two international organizations are combining their talents to deliver SSI (self-sovereign identity) and Verifiable Credentials for the ARUCC [MyCreds™](https://mycreds.ca/) virtual wallet. This groundbreaking work means the Canadian [MyCreds™](https://mycreds.ca/) credential wallet along with other international members of the Digitary global network will be able to reach an even higher bar of service delivery for mobile learners, creating a triangle of trust that includes them and the Canadian colleges and universities.
* [Adding support for Secure DID Messaging](https://medium.com/mattr-global/adding-support-for-secure-did-messaging-befb75a72feb) Mattr
  > We are excited to announce a new addition to our MATTR VII platform capabilities. As we continue to build out an extensive suite of features to support the exchange of data such as [Verifiable Credentials](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/), we have now added secure [Decentralized Identifier](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/) messaging capabilities to enable entirely new ways to communicate using our platform.
* [Adding support for revocation of Verifiable Credentials](https://mattr.global/adding-support-for-revocation-of-verifiable-credentials/)  leveraging the [Revocation List 2020](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vc-status-rl-2020/) draft from the CCG.
  > These innovations include our recent work related to using [BBS+ signatures](https://mattr.global/using-privacy-preserving-zkp-credentials-on-the-mattr-platform/) for privacy-preserving selective disclosure and our earlier work on the [OIDC Credential Provider spec](https://mattrglobal.github.io/oidc-client-bound-assertions-spec/). We’ve also been busy sharing new tools for [checking the syntax of a JSON-LD credential](https://mattr.global/new-to-json-ld-introducing-json-ld-lint/) during development.
