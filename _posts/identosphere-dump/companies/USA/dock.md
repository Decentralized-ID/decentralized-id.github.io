  > These development teams can of course spend time learning new concepts, but learning curves can be a barrier to adoption whereas fast and less complex integrations are certainly preferred by organizations. For these reasons, Dock is going to be making some of the network’s features available via an API, which is in effect a HTTP wrapper of our [SDK](https://github.com/docknetwork/sdk).
