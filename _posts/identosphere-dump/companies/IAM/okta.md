  > Together, Okta and Auth0 are reimagining identity’s role in every organization’s technology strategy. Cloud, mobile, and Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) have transformed the dynamics of the digital world over the past decade. At the same time, IT is struggling to keep up with all of these changes, and developers are more burdened than ever to build more applications quickly and without sacrificing security and user experience.

Today, we're taking a significant step forward — I'd go so far to call it a "leap" — to enhance the Okta Identity Cloud. We announced our agreement to join forces with Auth0, a leading identity platform for developers.

Auth0 will operate as an independent unit inside of Okta, and both platforms will be supported and invested in. As a result, organizations will have a wider breadth of identity solutions to fit their unique needs. Okta and Auth0’s comprehensive, complementary identity platforms are robust enough to serve the world’s largest organizations and flexible enough to address every identity use case, regardless of the audience or user.
