## Bloom

* [Bloom Attestation Service migrating to Verifiable Credentials](https://bloom.co/blog/migration-from-attestation-service-to-verified-credentials/) Bloom
  > To transition fully to the W3C VC standard, Bloom decided to deprecate the proprietary attestation format and adopt the new open VC standard. The transition will fulfill the vision of giving Bloom users complete, secure control of their private data, while allowing interoperability with the rest of the VC ecosystem.

## Applied Recognition
* [Biometrics come to verifiable credentials with Applied Recognition and Sovrin Foundation](https://www.biometricupdate.com/202105/biometrics-come-to-verifiable-credentials-with-applied-recognition-and-sovrin-foundation)

## Exostar

* [Exostar Receives Kantara Initiative’s Identity Assurance Trust Framework Certification](https://www.exostar.com/press/exostar-receives-kantara-initiatives-identity-assurance-trust-framework-certification-achieves-healthcare-and-life-science-community-milestones/) - Latest Recognition Further Demonstrates Company Protects Customers’ Identity and Personal Data by Complying with NIST 800-63 Standard
  > “This is a significant achievement and market differentiator for Exostar. The Kantara assessment and review process is rigorous and approval demonstrates a company’s care and respect for its customers.”
  

## Mattr
* [Issuing credentials directly to the MATTR mobile wallet](https://medium.com/mattr-global/issuing-credentials-directly-to-the-mattr-mobile-wallet-8e8cab931e2e) Mattr

If you’re already using a secure mechanism to authenticate your users, then setting up OIDC capability isn’t necessary. As we’ve explored, sending credentials using secure DID messaging directly or via a QR code or deep-link is safe, convenient and allows users to obtain their credentials directly.

## Gimly

* [Gimly ID: SSI with OpenID authentication](https://www.loom.com/share/d49e005bb32349d7950022e83d55b944)

About Dick Hardt’s new thing

Gimly ID is leading self-sovereign identity innovation, with the implementation of SSI with self-issued openID provider (SIOPv2) and full support for openID connect and DIF presentation exchange.

## Indicio

* [Indicio launches blockchain-enabled network for identity](https://indicio.tech/blog/indicio-launches-blockchain-enabled-network-for-identity/)
  > “Our clients asked for a stable, fully-staffed network based on Hyperledger Indy— one that could provide the  Service Level Agreements their customers need for mission-critical workloads,” said Heather Dahl, CEO of Indicio. “Today, we are excited to announce that this MainNet is open for business.”
  > 
  > “This is the network we need to accelerate adoption of passwordless zero trust ecosystems for enterprise customers” said Mike Vesey, President of [IdRamp](https://idramp.com), a leader in decentralized identity and a Genesis Node Operator on the Network.
* [Panel: Start Simple to Scale Decentralized Identity](https://hgf2021.sched.com/event/j3ej%23new_tab) HGF2021 • Indicio
  > Liquid Avatar Technologies and Indicio.tech will share how together they are transitioning the current KABN ID solution to verifiable credentials by building the Liquid Avatar Verifiable Credentials Ecosystem utilizing Hyperledger Aries, Ursa, and Indy.
* [Become a Node Operator](https://indicio.tech/blog/be-a-part-of-the-most-dynamic-network-community-in-decentralized-identity/) Indicio
  > we’ve seen a rapid rise in demand for robust, stable, and professionally maintained networks to support decentralized identity solutions. It’s not a surprise: decentralized identity’s moment has arrived. That’s why we’ve been hard at work creating Hyperledger Indy networks upon which developers all over the world are building, testing, and launching their solutions.
* [Indicio completes Hyperledger Indy DID Method—A Milestone in the Evolution of DID Interop](https://indicio.tech/indicio-completes-hyperledger-indy-did-method-a-milestone-in-the-evolution-of-decentralized-identity-network-interoperability/)

The Indy DID Method paves the way for Hyperledger Indy credentials to scale globally by allowing Indy networks to seamlessly interoperate and create a “network-of-networks” effect.


## Identos

* [Identos builds Verifiable Credentials into updated federated digital ID API](https://www.biometricupdate.com/202209/identos-builds-verifiable-credentials-into-updated-federated-digital-id-api) Biometric Update
