# Hyperledger umbrella

### DIDs Fabric and Decentralized Networking

* [DEON](https://www.hyperledger.org/blog/2020/11/05/deon-a-hyperledger-based-decentralized-off-grid-network) is a new Hyperledger project focused in off-line communication networks, independent of internet infrastructure. This could be used to enable networks of devices to communicate peer-to-peer (without the need to ‘phone home’ over the internet), inter-enterprise consortia networks, and enabling user-centric data sharing in a more secure and private fashion.
### Aries

* [GlobaliD releases new open source applications](https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-shares-ssi-code-at-the-internet-identity-workshop-446debec43e7)

They open source their open-sourced iOS and Android native Aries frameworks and donated them to the Hyperledger Aries project.

They also shared their Dynamic Governance API using GlobaliD Groups.

Accpting Applications until 1/10 4:00 PM PST

The total funding for the challenge is $70,000CDN and is divided into 4 phases. The first 3 phases require the use of Python working on the [Indy Node](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node).

The current credential verification process relies on transaction processing by a ledger with transaction processing bottlenecks, which may constrain the ideal of non-repudiation.
