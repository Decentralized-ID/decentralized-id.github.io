We kicked off the first Digital Identity Attestation Working Group meeting under the OpenSSF in August, 2020.

* [UPCOMING COMMUNITY CALL & NEW RESEARCH: BIOMETRICS IN THE HUMANITARIAN SECTOR](https://www.theengineroom.org/upcoming-community-call-new-research-biometrics-in-the-humanitarian-sector/) the Engine Room

In 2018 we worked with Oxfam to publish a [landmark report](https://www.theengineroom.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Engine-Room-Oxfam-Biometrics-Review.pdf) on the use of biometric data – fingerprints, iris scans, voiceprints and so on – in the humanitarian sector. Our report looked at how these types of data were being collected and used, and raised critical questions around potential risks and harms.

* [...]

If you’re a humanitarian practitioner or just interested in biometrics and responsible data, please join our upcoming Community Call, where we’ll be introducing the project and hearing from practitioners on the theme.

Scholarship recipients will be studying, researching, interning or working in a field relevant to one or more [OpenID Foundation working groups](https://openid.net/wg/) and consistent with Foundation’s Mission. The scholarship recipients will also be invited to participate in Foundation breakout meetings at the European Identity Conference and Identiverse which will provide exposure to both the Foundation’s business as well as leading technologists.

New IETF protocol

* [Secure Credential Transfer](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-secure-credential-transfer-03.html) Vinokurov, Byington, Lerch, Pelletier, Sha

This document describes a mechanism to transfer digital credentials securely between two devices. Secure credentials may represent a digital key to a hotel room, a digital key to a door lock in a house or a digital key to a car. Devices that share credentials may belong to the same or two different platforms (e.g. iOS and Android). Secure transfer may include one or more write and read operations. Credential transfer needs to be performed securely due to the sensitive nature of the information.

Upcoming Work Group Calls

A lot of activity in this community happens every week in work groups. We are going to make more of an effort to highlight calls that may be of interest to folks and to do more coverage and linking to calls from the previous week that are interesting to a wider audience.

* [The W3C’s Credentials Community is hosting a session on NFTs and Identity](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-credentials/2022Apr/0049.html). 4/12 [9am PST](https://meet.w3c-ccg.org/weekly)

There has been an explosion of interest in using NFT for identity, along with exploring how they could work with or support DIDs and VCs. Simone Ravaioli, Taylor Kendal and Heather Vescent have invited Evin Mcmullen of [Disco.xyz](https://www.disco.xyz/), Elina Cadouri of [Dock](https://www.dock.io/), Stepan Gershuni of [Affinidi](https://www.affinidi.com/) / [DeepSkills](https://www.deepskills.io/), and Dominik Beron of [Walt.id](https://walt.id/) to share their perspective on NFT identity and where it may overlap with DIDs and VCs
