* [Directory of Products That Assess Identification Documents and Verify Identity Version 2.0](https://diacc.ca/2021/05/03/directory-of-products-that-assess-identification-documents-and-verify-identity-version-2-0/)

This [Directory](https://diacc.ca/2020/05/21/directory-products-assess-identification-documents-verify-identity/) is designed to provide an overview of providers’ solutions which use government issued photo identification cards, combined with biometric facial scans, to establish Digital Identity.

Built on standards: OAuth 2.0 and JWT

Experts say that seized devices have become a trove of information for authorities cracking down on social movements and opposition leaders.

* [Calls for New FTC Rules to Limit Businesses’ Data Collection and Stop Data Abuse](https://anonyome.com/2021/07/calls-for-new-ftc-rules-to-limit-businesses-data-collection-and-stop-data-abuse/)

“I want to sound a note of caution around approaches that are centered around user control. I think transparency and control are important. I think it is really problematic to put the burden on consumers to work through the markets and the use of data, figure out who has their data, how it’s being used, make decisions … I think you end up with notice fatigue; I think you end up with decision fatigue; you get very abusive manipulation of dark patterns to push people into decisions.

* [Huge data leak shatters the lie that the innocent need not fear surveillance](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2021/jul/18/huge-data-leak-shatters-lie-innocent-need-not-fear-surveillance)

Few pause to think that their phones can be transformed into surveillance devices, with someone thousands of miles away silently extracting their messages, photos and location, activating their microphone to record them in real time.

Such are the capabilities of Pegasus, the spyware manufactured by NSO Group, the Israeli purveyor of weapons of mass surveillance.

* [NSO rejects](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2021/jul/18/response-from-nso-and-governments) this label. It insists only carefully vetted government intelligence and law enforcement agencies can use Pegasus, and only to penetrate the phones of “legitimate criminal or terror group targets”

* [10 assertions about the future of social](https://werd.io/2021/10-assertions-about-the-future-of-social)

We can’t solve identity. There will never be a single identity that we use across the web. Instead, there may be open protocols that allow us to auth with different providers.

* [How Social Engineering Has (And Hasn’t) Evolved Over Time](https://auth0.com/blog/how-social-engineering-has-and-hasnt-evolved-over-time/) auth0

In short: you can deploy all the technological measures you want, but unless you address the human element, an attacker can defeat your defenses with a simple phone call or email.

* [My Take on the Misframing of the Authentication Problem](https://kyledenhartog.com/misframing-authn/) Kyle Den Hartog

If you haven’t [read this paper](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~fms27/papers/2012-BonneauHerOorSta-password--oakland.pdf) before you design an authentication system you’re probably just reinventing something already created or missing a piece of the puzzle

* [...]

can anyone point me to an academic research paper or even some user research that tells me the probability that a user’s password will be discovered by an attacker in the next year? What about the probability that the user shares their password with a trusted person because the system wasn’t deployed with a delegation system? Or how about how the probability will drop as the user reuses their password across many websites? Simply put I think we’ve been asking the wrong question

* [Developers: SMS Authentication is Challenging](https://medium.com/magiclabs/building-sms-authentication-c2cabccbd5f8) Magic Labs

SMS (Short Message Service) messaging¹, despite a number of material challenges, has broad adoption, international regulations, and support across platforms.

Visa’s leadership in global payments and identity services as well as their longstanding commitment to standards will be of great value as we tailor our strategy to this moment.
* [Self-Sovereign Identity Working Group](https://europeanblockchainassociation.org/eba-working-group-self-sovereign-identity-eussi/) European Blockchain Association in collaboration with the European Commission

Right now, many enterprises and organisations are building their own SSI solutions by implementing the existing standards and protocols. Since all these parties do similar work and have to face similar problems, it is critical for the community to share these learnings and experiences openly.

* [Participate in Alberta's First Verifiable Digital Credentials Pilot](https://pilot.atbventures.com/) ATB Ventures and Govt Alberta

As a part of the pilot, you will add your MyAlberta Digital ID as a verifiable credential to your mobile digital wallet (on your smartphone) and use this digital credential to open an ATB Pay As You Go Account - Digital Credential account with ATB Financial.

* [What is Knowledge-based Authentication (KBA)?](https://www.pingidentity.com/en/company/blog/posts/2022/what-is-knowledge-based-authentication-kba.html) Ping Identity

When you set up a new account, you are often asked to create a password and choose a security question and answer (e.g., What is your mother's maiden name?). Answering security questions based on personal information when you log in to an app or system is called knowledge-based authentication (KBA).

* [A Responsible Reporting Nightmare: Right-clicking is Not a Crime](https://me2ba.org/a-responsible-reporting-nightmare-right-clicking-is-not-a-crime/) Me2Ba

This is a story of a politician who cried “hacker” after a reporter informed a state agency that sensitive information was embedded in their website’s HTML source code1. While we wish this was a joke or fictional story it, unfortunately, is not. If the state of Missouri does move forward with the prosecution this state action would sound the alarm for researchers and reporters resulting in a chilling effect on the practice of responsible reporting.

Our [understanding](https://twitter.com/toddmckinnon/status/1506184721922859010) is that during January 2022, hackers outside Okta had access to an Okta support employee’s account and were able to take actions as if they were that employee. In a screenshot shared on social media, a Cloudflare employee’s email address was visible, along with a popup indicating the hacker was posing as an Okta employee and could have initiated a password reset.

* [OpenID Foundation Publishes Whitepaper on Open Banking](https://openid.net/2022/03/18/openid-foundation-publishes-whitepaper-on-open-banking/)

* [FIDO passkeys are an existential threat to fintech startups](https://werd.io/2022/fido-passkeys-are-an-existential-threat-to-fintech-startups)

by definition, screen scraping requires storing a user’s financial system passwords in clear text. Nonetheless, you can bet that every system that integrates with payroll systems, and almost every system that integrates with banks (at a minimum), uses the technique. The US has badly needed [open banking style standards](https://standards.openbanking.org.uk/api-specifications/) for years.

A basic insight of MyData is that the current systems of data are asymmetrical, imbalanced, and unfair. A basic motivation of MyData is to fix this by addressing business, legal, technical, and societal aspects of those systems.

## Identity not SSI

* [Fixing Web Login](https://www.windley.com/archives/2022/06/fixing_web_login.shtml) Phil Windley

Like the "close" buttons for elevator doors, "keep me logged in" options on web-site authentication screens feel more like a placebo than something that actually works. Getting rid of passwords will mean we need to authenticate less often, or maybe just don't mind as much when we do.
