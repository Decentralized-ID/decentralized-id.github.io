# Standards


* [DIDs are not enough - we need an Authoriziation standard too](https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/api-access-security-for-dapps-cfcfa928623c) Energy Web

If you are a developer and want to write a DApp [...] you probably are using API-Keys in your front-end. If this is the case, then you should consider the security risk the publication of the API-Key in your front end represents and ask yourself if it would make sense to switch to a user authentication scheme.


## In general
* [FYI: What makes a standard ‘world class’?](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-credentials/2021Aug/0213.html) Michael Herman (Trusted Digital Web) (Saturday, 14 August)
  > - A world class standard should have well-defined objectives that respond to real needs in a timely manner.
  > - Its technical content should be complete and accurate.
  > - It should be easy to understand (or as easy as the subject matter allows!) and easy to implement.
  > - Its requirements should be expressed clearly and unambiguously.
  > - It should be validated.
  > - It should be well-maintained.
  > 
  > Reference: [A Guide To Writing World Class Standards](https://www.etsi.org/images/files/Brochures/AGuideToWritingWorldClassStandards.pdf)
* [Trust Frameworks? Standards Matter](https://medium.com/@trbouma/trust-frameworks-standards-matter-47c946992f44) Tim Bouma
  > He points at the NIST documents about it [Developing Trust Frameworks to Support Identity Federations](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2018/NIST.IR.8149.pdf) published in 2018. He also points at the Canadian government’s definition of standards.
  > 
  > “a document that provides a set of agreed-upon rules, guidelines or characteristics for activities or their results. Standards establish accepted practices, technical requirements, and terminologies for diverse fields.”  He goes on to highlight a lot of the work being done in Canada and where it all sits relative to being a standard - “In closing, there are lots of trust frameworks being developed today. But to be truly trusted, a trust framework needs to either apply existing standards or become a standard itself.”
* [Open standards should be developed openly](https://blog.weareopen.coop/open-standards-should-be-developed-openly-1f0cf552308d) WeAreOpen
  > Open standards should be developed openly because not enough people work to ensure that equity is central to innovation and development. We believe that openness is an attitude, and one which bears fruit over time from which everyone can benefit.

* [Global Standards Mapping Initiative](https://www.continuumloop.com/global-standards-mapping-initiative/) ContinuumLoop

This past November, the GBBC released [The Global Standards Mapping Initiative 2.0](https://gbbcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GBBC-GSMI-2.0-Report-1.pdf), updating the [standards published in 2020](https://gbbcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GSMI-Legal-Regulatory-Report.pdf). The GBBC is a strong proponent of standardization and intends to serve as a baseline for establishing frameworks and standards that will allow for adoption and innovation.
* [Premature Standardization & Interoperability](https://www.continuumloop.com/premature-standardization-interoperability/) Continuum Loop

Here’s my premise – we don’t have standards nor interoperability – at least not as people really need. We have been through a process that is powerful and good – but what we have is what I call “premature standardization.” It’s a great start but nowhere near where things will be.

* [Trinsic Basics: What Are SSI Standards?](https://trinsic.id/what-are-ssi-standards/)
  > There are two kinds of standards that Trinsic implements to enable interoperability and avoid vendor lock-in: data model standards and protocol standards.

* [Manifesto: Rules for standards-makers](http://scripting.com/2017/05/09/rulesForStandardsmakers.html)
  > I've used all kinds of formats and protocols in a long career as a software developer, even created a few. My new manifesto summarizes what I've learned about what works and what doesn't.

## Formal Objection

* [Re: historical background regarding success of responses to formal objections](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-credentials/2021Sep/0076.html) Liam R. E. Quin (Monday, 13 September)
  > In the 17 years i worked at W3C, the formal objections were
  > 
  > (1) "we [the objector] wanted to be on record as saying this but go ahead and publish" (the most common);\
  > (2) we [the objector] have a product, or are about to ship a product, and the feature(s) in  this spec would cause problems in the short-term for our product, and that's more important to us than the Web (no-one will ever admit to this but it's not uncommon)\
  > (3) we object to this spec, we prefer another approach, so here's a bunch of fake objections to slow things down because we can't share our actual business strategy\
  > (4) we believe there's a technical problem with this spec, but we didn't notice it over the past four years despite a last call  review (this one is actually rare but does happen)\

Schema.org was founded on the idea of making it easier and simpler for the ordinary, everyday sites that make up the web to use machine-readable data, and for that data to enable an ecosystem of applications used by millions of people. While it's hard to predict exactly what the next decade will bring, if we can all keep these founding concerns in mind as we improve, refine and curate our growing collection of schemas, we'll be doing our part to continue improving the web.

## Oasis
* [Managed Open Projects: A New Way For Open Source and Open Standards To Collaborate](https://www.oasis-open.org/2021/09/08/managed-open-projects/)

I recently pointed out in a [TechCrunch contribution](https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/09/a-revival-at-the-intersection-of-open-source-and-open-standards/) that the open source and open standards communities need to find ways to team up if they are to continue driving innovation and  development of transformative technologies to push our society forward.

## JSON

* [What Is ISO 27001:2013? A Guide for Businesses](https://auth0.com/blog/what-is-iso-27001-2013-a-guide-for-businesses/)
  > ISO 27001 is also the cornerstone of a growing international consensus about data security best practices. Australia based its federal Digital Security Policy on ISO 27001. Likewise, ISO 27001 can provide guidance on how to meet the standards of other data privacy laws, such as the GDPR, which often direct companies to it as an example of universal best practices. So if you abide by ISO 27001’s recommendations, you’re on the right track for legal compliance, not to mention improved data security.

## Blockcerts
* [Blockcerts V3 release](https://community.blockcerts.org/t/blockcerts-v3-release/3022)

The main change is the alignment with the [W3C Verifiable Credentials specification 3](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/).

Regarding the standard itself metadata and display are entering the default standard. metadata comes in replacement of metadataJson and remains a stringified JSON that will allow consumers to register specific data which are too unique for issuances to be defined in the context.

display brings in [a little bit of novelty 2](https://github.com/blockchain-certificates/cert-schema/blob/master/cert_schema/3.0/displaySchema.json%23L6) images or pdfs, in addition to the more classic HTML.

The arrow for “Issue Credentials” is exactly the same as “Send Presentation,” leading us to believe these activities are similar, but how are they similar? We can’t adequately answer these questions by looking at the above picture and the specification doesn’t provide a ton of help either…


## GAIN

An alternative to passwords that includes QR Codes is described, and typical use cases are described. This document also provides an overview and context for using QR Codes for security purposes.

## PICO

* [The Most Inventive Thing I've Done](https://www.windley.com/archives/2022/07/the_most_inventive_thing_ive_done.shtml) Phil Windley

every pico is serverless and cloud-native, presenting an API that can be fully customized by developers. Because they're persistent, picos support databaseless programming with intuitive data isolation. As an actor-model programming system, different picos can operate concurrently without the need for locks, making them a natural choice for easily building decentralized systems.
W3C Press Release - [Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) v1.0 becomes a W3C Recommendation](https://www.w3.org/2022/07/pressrelease-did-rec) worth reading to see who contributed comments (and notice who didn’t)

For individuals in particular, DIDs can put them back in control of their personal data and consent, and also enable more respectful bi-directional trust relationships where forgery is prevented, privacy is honored, and usability is enhanced.

## Verification
* [Verification Patterns, Part 1](https://docs.centre.io/blog/verification-patterns-1) Verite

Since verification is off-chain (and generally fast/inexpensive, depending on the provider), and since this avoids on-chain storage of potentially correlatable data, this is often the preferred solution.

## Trust Registries

* [Managing Trust and Reputation via Trust Registries](https://www.continuumloop.com/managing-trust-and-reputation-via-trust-registries/) Continuum Loop

The concept behind a Trust Registry is that a Wallet needs to know which decentralized identifiers (DIDs) to “trust” as a source of truth. At many levels, this “trust” translates to “authority” – knowing that somebody, centralized or decentralized, is responsible for maintaining a list of trusted DIDs.

### ONDC
* [ONDC: An Open Network for Ecommerce](https://www.windley.com/archives/2022/08/ondc_an_open_network_for_ecommerce.shtml) Phil Windley
* [Open Network for Digital Commerce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Network_for_Digital_Commerce) is a non-profit established by the Indian government to develop open ecommerce. The goal is to end platform monopolies in ecommerce using an open protocol called [Beckn](https://developers.becknprotocol.io/). I'd never heard of Beckn before. From the reaction on the VRM mailing list, not many there had either.

## Apple \ Google
* [Apple, with support from Google, just announced the Mobile Document Request API](https://github.com/WICG/proposals/issues/67) Web Incubator CG
  > The API is concerning because it lists "Define the native communication between the User Agent and the application holding the mdoc." as out of scope. That is, digital wallet selection is out of scope. Also out of scope is "issuing" and "provisioning". The specification focuses on delivery from a digital wallet to a website.


## JWT

* [Podcast] [Privacy-preserving measures and SD-JWT with Daniel Fett](https://identityunlocked.auth0.com/public/49/Identity%252C-Unlocked.--bed7fada/3bbcbab8) IdentityUnlocked Auth0

The discussion gets very concrete when Daniel describes selective disclosure JWT, or SD-JWT, a new IETF specification he is coauthoring that offers a simple and easy-to-adopt approach to produce JWTs capable of supporting selective disclosure. Here at Identity, Unlocked, we are huge fans of this new specification, and we hope this episode will help you get started!

## C2PA
* [FYI: C2PA Releases Specification of World’s First Industry Standard for Content Provenance](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-credentials/2022Jan/0207.html)  Leonard Rosenthol (Wednesday, 26 January)

Just wanted to update folks here that the C2PA has released version 1.0 of their specification at [https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/1.0/index.html](https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/1.0/index.html).  As previously mentioned, it includes native support for VC’s for use in identification of actors (be they human, organizations, etc.).  Thanks to everyone here for their input on our work and helping us to deliver.
