* [Four Future Scenarios about Identity & Access in 2040](https://esatus.com/wp-content/uploads/Broschuere_eng_final.html). We talk about Total Surveillance, Mega Corporations, Identity Chaos & Self-Sovereign Identity 2.0.
  > After a look into the past and present, we now fast-forward to the year 2040, where we meet Julia and accompany her through her everyday life. In four different IAM future scenarios, which can be viewed separately, we will understand how life under total surveillance feels for Julia. In times where identity chaos prevails, we can see what it means when Julia can no longer be sure about her digital identity, with only her physical identity being certain. In a world dominated by mega corporations Julia‘s experiences with her employer show us the far-reaching significance and influence such corporations have gained in relation to IAM. Finally, we experience how Julia is able to regain her informational self-determination thanks to her identity wallet - Self-Sovereign Identity 2.0.

This is not important only for respecting citizens’ rights, but it is crucial to building sustainable services and humane cities.

  > Katryna believes that it is vital for the future of the internet that people and organisations obtain control of their data. This concept is called ‘data sovereignty’, but achieving that means rethinking the digital infrastructure the current internet is built upon. She calls for a soft infrastructure that consists of agreements between public and private-sector parties about the access to data.

  > enables sovereignty for individuals over their digital assets and credentials -such as digital passports, digital diplomas, digital property titles, and tokenized currencies such as dollar, euro, pound, or pesos- using digital wallets that can take the form of a mobile app. Secondly, when the subject of these digital assets and credentials presents them to a third party to prove ownership, the third party does not need to reach out to the issuer to verify them, as they can go against a public, decentralized, and immutable registry, such as a blockchain network, where the cryptographic proofs of the asset or credential were registered and are maintained by the issuer in an standardized and trustable way.
