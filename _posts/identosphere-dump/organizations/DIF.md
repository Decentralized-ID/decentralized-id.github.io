In particular, Affinidi has been at the forefront in building many components such as the [Affinidi Wallet](https://academy.affinidi.com/what-is-affinidis-digital-wallet-1c2a52b4d13f), Schema Manager, [Consent Manager](https://build.affinidi.com/), and more that have enhanced the adoption of decentralised identity among communities and individuals.

These will probably always differ and make a universal abstraction impossible; and that’s not a bad thing! These requirements are always going to be specific to each regulatory context, and without them, innovation (and large-scale investment) are endangered by regulatory uncertainty.

The Interoperability working group will be tracking them and providing guidance and documentation where possible. Importantly, though, there is a new DIF Working Group coming soon, the Wallet Security WG, which will dive deeper into these profiles and requirements, benefiting from a narrow scope and IPR protection, allowing them to speak more bluntly about the above-mentioned details.

Having shown in our last piece how interoperability “profiles” are designed, we now tackle some key technical problem areas ripe for this kind of profile-first interoperability work across stacks.

* [DIF Interoperability Survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfbFh4DQeyI0msXsWvfpbrtYEfgQrGRD7tw4d2Rg0NEyhvcKQ/viewform)

We are keen to support more interoperability activity and hopefully testing this fall and winter. In order to do this we would like to gather feedback from the community as to where we are at so we can assess how to move forward.

Please Note: Information on this survey will be shared with the chairs of the DIF Interop Group
