* [Here's how you get started:](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vj811aUbs8GwZUNo-LIFBHafsz4rZTSnRtPv7RQaqNc/edit%23heading%3Dh.f28tyzjvad8g)

This process is open to anyone -- no W3C Membership dues, fees, etc. required to participate.

* [Reminder: You can present to the CCG](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-credentials/2022Mar/0151.html)

This is a friendly reminder that anyone in the community that is doing something interesting that you think the community should know about whether that work is done here in the CCG or elsewhere, can email the chairs with what you want to share and we can get you on the calendar. It's best if you email all 3 chairs.

* [Clarity about the group charter](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-credentials/2022Jun/0044.html) Manu Sporny (Wednesday, 22 June)

there are statements like: "Buy our products! We're the best!" (with nothing else that we can learn from) that is frowned upon... but, in general, even if it is a feature in one of your products, chances are that we want to hear about it if it has relevance to how we might interoperate on that feature (or use it to meet a goal of the community).
