* [Chris Raczkowski](mailto:chris@sovrin.org) introduced this topic with the aim of familiarizing participants with the Letter of Agreement signed between the Sovrin Foundation and the Trust over IP Foundation.

* [...]

The Letter of Agreement puts forward three main items:

1. Mutual recognition and support for the distinct, but interrelated, mandate of each organization.
2. Commitment to name a member from each organization as a liaison to act as a point of contact and maintain lines of open communication.
3. Proactively seek opportunities to collaborate in areas of shared interest, including communications products.

This Letter of Agreement has been approved and signed by Sovrin and Trust over IP.

It will be the basis for ongoing activity that aims to build on the strengths of both communities and advance their shared interest in the emergence of secure, privacy enhancing credential and identity ecosystems.

David Luchuk, Program Manager for Trust over IP, addressed the importance of ensuring that Sovrin and Trust over IP’s mutual support for one another is clearly presented to the market to the broader community represented here at IIW.

* [Chris Raczkowski](mailto:chris@sovrin.org)indicated that a joint announcement would be developed in the very near term.

Editorial: Kaliya thinks this is a terrible idea. It is based on the premise that identity providers (issuers of credentials) should get paid every time a person (the holder) presents the credential in their wallet, when shared with the relying party (verifier) I think this is toxic and we are just finally getting to aligned standards for the VC format and for exchange protocols - now some how we are going to rapidly add a payments layer?

NO this isn’t going to work it is going to create lockin to particular wallets for particular credentials. All because some bad entrepreneurs who are no longer leading their companies sold SAFTS to greedy investors. There is a mess under here that should be exposed further now that they are trying to push this model again. Lets just say I can’t wait for the investigative reporter to dig into the Sovrin meltdown from last year further to see what is really there. It could have all been left alone and I wouldn’t be talking about it - but they decided to push the model again.

Now, if we take two communities within the SSI space – the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF) and the Trust over IP Foundation (ToIP). I will sometimes hear people talking positively about one and negatively about the other. But why is this happening? Don’t we all have the same underlying values? Aren’t we all looking to better our lives through digital sovereignty?

I think the answer to this is clear and we need to get away from thinking in a binary manner about anything in our space. And if you really look at the overlap between both these communities: they are quite large.
