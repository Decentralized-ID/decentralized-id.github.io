Three new TOIP Task Forces

The ToIP Technology Stack Working group is starting an - [Artificial Intelligence and the Metaverse (AIM) Task Force](https://trustoverip.org/blog/2022/07/20/announcing-artificial-intelligence-metaverse-technology-task-force/)

More details are available at [AI & Metaverse Technology Task Force – Home – Confluence (trustoverip.org)](https://wiki.trustoverip.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId%3D19657312) (next meeting [8/4](https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Calendar%2Bof%2BToIP%2BMeetings))

The ToIP Governance Stack Working group is starting a - Governance Architecture Task Force

After the original development of the [ToIP Governance Architecture Specification](https://trustoverip.org/permalink/ToIP-Governance-Architecture-Specification-V1.0-2021-12-21.pdf) and ToIP [Governance Metamodel Specification](https://trustoverip.org/permalink/ToIP-Governance-Metamodel-Specification-V1.0-2021-12-21.pdf), the plan had been to start creating layer-specific templates.  However the Governance Layer TF, led by Alex Tweeddale, Carly Huitema, and Kyle Robinson—with input from Stephen Curran— concluded that component-based templates made more sense. Thus the new Governance Architecture TF will launch based on the components in the ToIP Tech Architecture Stack

The ToIP Concepts and Terminology Working group is proposing starting a - Mental Models Task Force

- Mental models explain in detail how a set of concepts are related within a specific domain—a “mini-ontology”
- They are usually documented both in writing and in UML diagrams
- They add much greater depth and cross-conceptual understanding than glossaries alone
- The CTWG is proposing to start up a new Mental Models Task Force in September if there is sufficient interest
