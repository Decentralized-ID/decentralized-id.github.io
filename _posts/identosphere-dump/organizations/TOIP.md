# Trust over IP Foundation

* [Announcing the Artificial Intelligence and Metaverse Technology Task Force](https://trustoverip.org/blog/2022/07/20/announcing-artificial-intelligence-metaverse-technology-task-force/)

Three new TOIP Task Forces

The ToIP Technology Stack Working group is starting an - [Artificial Intelligence and the Metaverse (AIM) Task Force](https://trustoverip.org/blog/2022/07/20/announcing-artificial-intelligence-metaverse-technology-task-force/)

More details are available at [AI & Metaverse Technology Task Force – Home – Confluence (trustoverip.org)](https://wiki.trustoverip.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId%3D19657312) (next meeting [8/4](https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Calendar%2Bof%2BToIP%2BMeetings))

The ToIP Governance Stack Working group is starting a - Governance Architecture Task Force

After the original development of the [ToIP Governance Architecture Specification](https://trustoverip.org/permalink/ToIP-Governance-Architecture-Specification-V1.0-2021-12-21.pdf) and ToIP [Governance Metamodel Specification](https://trustoverip.org/permalink/ToIP-Governance-Metamodel-Specification-V1.0-2021-12-21.pdf), the plan had been to start creating layer-specific templates.  However the Governance Layer TF, led by Alex Tweeddale, Carly Huitema, and Kyle Robinson—with input from Stephen Curran— concluded that component-based templates made more sense. Thus the new Governance Architecture TF will launch based on the components in the ToIP Tech Architecture Stack

The ToIP Concepts and Terminology Working group is proposing starting a - Mental Models Task Force

- Mental models explain in detail how a set of concepts are related within a specific domain—a “mini-ontology”
- They are usually documented both in writing and in UML diagrams
- They add much greater depth and cross-conceptual understanding than glossaries alone
- The CTWG is proposing to start up a new Mental Models Task Force in September if there is sufficient interest

Following the [September announcement of its first tools for managing risk in digital trust ecosystems](https://trustoverip.org/blog/2021/09/23/trust-over-ip-foundation-issues-its-first-tools-for-managing-risk-in-digital-trust-ecosystems/), today the ToIP Foundation announced three more pairs of tools to assist in the task of generating digital governance and trust assurance schemes


* [OPN-R (Open Public Notice - Rights) - starting Notice & Control Language - for people to use rights and govern identity (govinterop) with @ Kantara, ToiP and W3C Data Privacy Vocabulary using international vocab - from ISO/IEC 29100 Legal Framework Vocabulary](https://iiw.idcommons.net/22F/_OPN-R_-_Open_Public_Notice_-_Rights_-_starting_Notice_and_Control_Language) by Mark Lizar

The language consists of

- International standard vocabulary for security and privacy frameworks provides roles and actors to govern the transfer of personal data.
- The active state notice and consent receipt - is a format for generating consent records from notice/policy - which provides people with information to use rights. .
- W3C Data Privacy Control Vocabulary and ISO/IEC 29100, Legal Framework Vocabulary

This language can be used to auto generate receipts to process rights and negotiate terms ..  At Kantara we are working to use the standards to auto read the notices/polices to provide a conformance / trust assessment for people so they can see risk independently of the service provider

We discussed these projects and have some links

Digital credentials can be checked in real time, expediting access to trustworthy information. These trusted, verifiable digital credentials are the core digital trust technologies being piloted and the trust ecosystem in which they operate are defined in ToIP architecture, governance, and related documents.

  > As we’re looking to move from the current internet era towards this new era of digital trust, I think it would be helpful if you were able to give an overview of how we got here. Perhaps we can take a step back, before the internet era, and discuss the paper credential era — I think that sets a good framework for where we’re going with these new digital trust models.

- Survey was a collaborative efforts by [University of Jyväskylä](http://jyu.fi), [Blockster.global](http://blockster.global) and [Trust over IP foundation](https://trustoverip.org/)
- More than 70 survey respondents
- SSI platform provider is ok but it should not be combined with network provider
- Risk: Slow technology adoption/ implementation / maturity
- Large VC issuance:
- Healthcare (COVID credentials)
- Revocation could be a challenge to be addressed
- Education sector
- Milestones to be achieved:
- Standardization
- Crypto payment
- Many solution would benefit from global payments but this will further add the challenge of large business adoption SSI + Crypto combination
- SDO:
- Not moving fast
- More academic and research in nature
