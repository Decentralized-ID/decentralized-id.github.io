* [Why we need new, nationwide personal data infrastructure](https://medium.com/mydex/why-we-need-new-nationwide-personal-data-infrastructure-56513fb6daf4)

The central plank of Mydex CIC’s consultation response is that the UK needs to build a new layer of data logistics infrastructure that:

- Includes citizens in the workings of the data economy, empowering them with the ability to collect, store, use and share data about themselves independently of any data controllers they may have data relationships with.
- To achieve this, the Government needs to ensure that every citizen is provided with their own personal data store, which enables citizens to collect, store, share and use their own data, under their own control, for their own purposes, independently of any organisation that may have collected data about them.
- These personal data stores should be designed to act as neutral, enabling nodes in a vibrant data sharing network, whereby citizens can obtain copies of their data held by organisations and can forward relevant elements of this data (such as Verified Attributes) to other data users under their control, as and when beneficial and necessary.

- Before: Your personal data stored separately in the silos of various domain services…
- After: Keep in one place and share easily. Then utilized by other apps and selectively disclosed to 3rd parties

  > Joanne stated the company’s aim is to extol the benefits of giving app developers rapid ability to create hyper-personalised services built on ethical data with ingrained consent controls and privacy-by-design principles. Crucially, a lot of ADX’s efforts are going into making it clear to fintechs and innovators that fundamental backend system services already exist, and are ready to be utilised to fast track new products and services into the market today, not in some mythical future.

  > This is the third in a series of blogs providing edited extracts from Mydex CIC’s response to the UK Government [consultation around a new National Data Strategy](https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/uk-national-data-strategy-nds-consultation).

The first focused on [how to unleash the full potential of personal data](https://medium.com/mydex/how-to-unleash-the-full-potential-of-data-3676db8d7c03), the second on why [every citizen should be provided with their own personal data store](https://medium.com/mydex/how-to-unleash-the-full-potential-of-data-3676db8d7c03). This blog explains why this strategy can be quick and easy to implement.

  > It is not possible to make good policy decisions about priorities for investments, grants, innovation and research projects or rules and regulations if the grounds for these decisions are faulty. Currently, effective policy making is hampered by widespread misunderstandings about where the biggest economic opportunities lie, the nature of issues such as control, and the role of citizens in the workings of the data economy.

Notably, the Department withdrew its original language mandating the “Privacy Options” icon. In its place is new language making commercial use of the icons optional only.  In other words, our stated concerns about the icons were well received, and ultimately adopted.

2. Cities are becoming pioneers of MyData.

3. Design is fundamental to the success of the MyData paradigm.

4. The journey of interoperability is all about the dialogue between governance and standards.

5. What’s missing is as important as what’s there.

* [Applying for, and being, a MyData Operator](https://www.informationanswers.com/2021/02/03/applying-for-and-being-a-mydata-operator/)

Ian Henderson talks about leading the application process for two MyData Operators [Tru.net](https://www.tru.net/) and [DataYogi](https://datayogi.me/) .

> The core of the awards process is an online questionnaire that each photo-operator completes which provides background on the applying organisation, and then allows them to describe their business in terms of the shared MyData Operator Reference model shown below. This reference model, described in detail in the MyData Operators white paper, is not prescriptive; it is more a useful way to ensure each applying operator frames their responses so that they become easier to understand and assess.

MyLog/LogBoard pulls together health information on temperature, sleep, heart rate and more into a single place that can be shared with doctors and medical staff. Users can log their Covid symptoms, thereby allowing them and medical staff to get a holistic picture of their health while strengthening the national response to Covid-19. Data is held on mobile devices and not in the cloud and can be shared with a one-off URL that wipes all data after 72 hours.

As highlighted by the ongoing Facebook Files scandal, transparency and accountability in personal data are increasingly acknowledged as critical for safety online.  To show their commitment to ethical personal data management, participating organisations are required to disclose information about their operations. The MyData Operator Award shows that ethical alternatives exist and provide value for companies and users alike.
The [Internet Society Foundation recently granted the Me2B Alliance $100,000](https://me2ba.org/me2b-alliance-awarded-100k-grant-for-us-pre-k-12-benchmark-to-research-school-utility-apps-data-sharing/) to complete its “U.S. EdTech Industry Benchmark: Data Sharing in Primary & Secondary School Mobile Utility Apps.” The benchmark will build on previous findings about harmful data sharing practices by uncovering how sensitive student information is being treated by school utility apps in grades pre-k through 12 in schools across the nation.

This infrastructure is now live and operational, officially recognised as a supplier to public services on procurement platforms in both England and Scotland and independently accredited for data management security under ISO 27001.
