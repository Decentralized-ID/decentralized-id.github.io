* [DID Conference Korea 2022 Recap – Identity Proofing, Passwordless Sign-in and User-friendly Digital Identity](https://idramp.com/did-conference-korea-2022-recap-identity-proofing-passwordless-sign-in-and-user-friendly-digital-identity/) idRamp

The presentation focused on the keys to mainstream DID adoption:

- Focus on practical business value
- Better data protection vs debates on the value of decentralized/centralized systems
- Stronger Zero Trust security vs details on blockchain, DIDs, and, ZKPs and ledgers
- Easy password elimination and superior privacy vs sociological discussion on SSI and data economy
- Trust as strategic brand advantage vs a long walk into new governance operation
- Verifiable Credentials to accelerate service delivery and reduce cost of IAM
- Optimize existing systems incrementally

First, I want to address the elephant in the room. Identiverse was an in-person conference, the first major technology conference that I’ve heard of since the pandemic started. I was a bit spooked when I thought about attending. I reviewed their [Covid-19 FAQ page](https://identiverse.com/faq/) carefully and was impressed by how they were planning to make sure attendees were safe.

It was mentioned in nearly every analyst session, and I couldn’t help but notice the number of vendors who have incorporated this concept into their marketing and their booth displays.
