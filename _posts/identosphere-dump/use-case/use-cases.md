TravelScrum Co-founder and Chairman Gene Quinn described self-sovereign ID (SSI) as “a big wave of change that’s coming,” and advised that organizations can “ride this wave by swimming at it, greeting it, and rolling gently over it as it heads to shore, or you can be caught in the shore-break and have it consume you later.”

State agency feedback:

- Identity is at the heart
- Disconnect between the data desired and the data entered
- Confusing fields, more confusing mapping
- Mismatched data
- Stick to 99% of a standard

School has changed:

- Used to be:
- District organized by physical location
- Revenue systems based on seat time
- School buildings
- Classrooms divided into grades
- Teachers as sage on the stage
- COVID:
- Some kids still out of school
- Playlists, virtual classrooms, hybrid
- Access to food. Access to internet. Access to a device.
- Teachers maxed to the limit
- FUTURE:
- Learning Loss?!?
- Social Emotional Learning?!?
- 1/3 of students expected not to return
- Virtual models abound
- Teacher mobility and agency
- Chaos versus Opportunity?

Questions for discussion:

- Identity technical solutions are easy. The data clean up and alignment is the first problem to solve.
- How can self attestation be trustworthy?
- What are the responsibilities of a proxy issuer?
- How far can we move people's cheese before they rebel?

  > Could DIDs and VCs help with systems architected with Zero Trust in mind? Yeah, probably:

> 1) You could use VCs to prove that you should have certain levels of access to certain systems. Checking this could happen automatically, but while ensuring that you're "live" and not some bot.

> 3) ZCAPs could be used to provide fine-grained access to very specific resources, even behind the firewall, within an organizations systems.
> DIDs could power much of this... but shouldn't promise any of it. The closest we could probably get to what you're asking, Adrian, is to align the Zero Trust Architecture principles to how DIDs and VCs can help -- primarily around: identity verification (VCs), login authentication (DIDs), least-privilege access (ZCAPs, Confidential Storage), and HTTP API access authorization (ZCAPs).

  > The most important message from the SolarWinds hack and much of the ransomware havoc is that our systems are not set up for individual accountability or independent audit.

> The VC and ZCAPs perspective is inadequate. As an SSI community we need to address the separation of concerns between authentication, authorization, and audit as equally important and needing a harmonized best-practice perspective. Standardized EDVs are table stakes but not terribly relevant to the protocols that link authentication, authorization, and audit. Confidential Storage should be adopting the protocols that connect authentication, authorization, and audit rather than introducing protocols narrowly scoped to the narrow and obvious role of encryption at rest.
