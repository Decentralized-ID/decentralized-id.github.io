# Real World Implementations

* [Transforming Scottish Education on the Blockchain](https://digitalscot.net/education-blockchain/) DigitalScot

A pertinent example of how this can be applied in the corporate world is this example of the [Scottish Social Services Council uses them](https://www.badges.sssc.uk.com/getting-started/what-you-need-to-know-about-open-badges/) to underpin workforce learning. The BCS describes this as the [future of professional development](https://www.bcs.org/content-hub/digital-badging-the-future-of-professional-development/), with many organizations like [Siemens](https://new.siemens.com/uk/en/company/education/teachers/siemens-digital-badges.html) using them this way.

Epic Post

You might think that I have lost my mind. We have just reported that our Indy SDK based DID agency is [AIP 1.0](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/main/concepts/0302-aries-interop-profile/README.md) compatible, and everything is wonderful. What’s going on?
* [Innovative Startups join forces to create a trusted training record and build a secure and safe waste data tracking system](https://www.digicatapult.org.uk/news-and-insights/press/digital-catapult-and-sellafield-ltd-join-forces-with-two-innovative-startups)
* [Digital Catapult](https://www.digicatapult.org.uk/) and [Sellafield Ltd](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/sellafield-ltd) have selected two innovative startups, [Condatis](https://condatis.com/), and [Jitsuin](https://jitsuin.com/), to implement advanced digital technology solutions to support the nuclear industry to continue to monitor skills within the sector, and to provide a trusted and secure record for tracking hazardous waste and materials.

* [Digitizing the 1st Mile with Blockchain, AI, and Self Sovereign Identity Connecting Coffee Farmers from Field to 1st Sip in Sustainable Supply Chains with Farmer Connect](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/supply-chain-revolution/id1496899179?i%3D1000507363757) Supply Chain Revolution

Think about the journey of a coffee bean from East Africa to the consumer. Thousands of miles away in the 1 sip to field wrapped in a complex, and often unsustainable, inequitable supply chain. There are 25 million people living in the coffee ecosystem, and 2.5 billion coffee drinkers worldwide, and that number is expected to 2-3X in coming years.
## Cerebrum
* [Cerebrum Launches Identity Pittsburgh Initiative in Partnership with Carnegie Mellon University's ETIM Program](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cerebrum-launches-identity-pittsburgh-initiative-in-partnership-with-carnegie-mellon-universitys-etim-program-301616404.html) PRNewswire

One example use case is medical records, which are often stored in central repositories and are hard for patients to access or share. Verifiable credentials offer an alternative — have patients store their medical records in digital wallets they control — which solves issues with interoperability, data ownership, and data access.
### CDE Services
* [Age-Verification Solution TruAge to be Deployed by CDE Services, Inc., Expanding Access to Convenience Stores Nationwide](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/age-verification-solution-truage-to-be-deployed-by-cde-services-inc-expanding-access-to-convenience-stores-nationwide-301597284.html) PRNewswire

"The convenience retailing industry conducts 165 million transactions a day and 50 million of them involve an age-restricted product. It is exciting to announce that TruAge will be implemented into thousands of stores that conduct age-restricted transactions," said TruAge CEO Kyle McKeen.
