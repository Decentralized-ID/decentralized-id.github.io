It’s quite important to outline the difference between #selfsovereignidentity and centralised solutions in the development of #covid #vaccinepassports.

The former requires zero trust on third parties, the latter is prone to hacking and abuse.

* [Architecture for Covid-19 Vaccine Passports](https://digitalscot.net/covid-19-vaccine-passports/)
  > As they explain [here](https://nds.nhs.scot/blog/the-national-clinical-data-store/), their National Clinical Data Store (NCDS) is storing vaccinations data and being made accessible to healthcare staff, via their [VMT app](https://learn.nes.nhs.scot/42708/turas-vaccination-management-tool).

“Under the bonnet, the VMT sends copies of the records of immunisations to the NCDS. For those that may be interested, this is achieved using a “FHIR API” based on the [UK FHIR Core](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/fhir-uk-core) Immunisation Profile. A FHIR API is essentially an industry standard way of sharing digital health data. The NCDS can then securely share citizens’ immunisation history records to other services, again using a FHIR API.”

As we’ll explore in the upcoming and future webinars, Scotland’s opportunity is to build upon this core innovation through a collaborating community, a Digital Healthcare Ecosystem, to flesh it out in multiple directions including ways to expand user uptake and to enable new scenarios for how users interact with and update data.

* [Coming Soon: The ‘Vaccine Passport’](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/04/travel/coronavirus-vaccine-passports.html)
  > “The global passport system took 50 years to develop,” said Drummond Reed, chief trust officer for Evernym. “Even when they wanted to add biometrics to that to make it stronger, that took over a decade to agree on just how you’re going to add a fingerprint or a facial biometric to be verified on a passport. Now, in a very short period of time, we need to produce a digital credential that can be as universally recognized as a passport and it needs an even greater level of privacy because it’s going to be digital.”

Solution assumption with the Good Health Pass is revoking is not necessary as VCs are short lived (solution to invalid credential). Issuers will re-issue vs. revoke

In many cases, labs are providing incorrect information in vaccination records, which need to be re-issued

·         Still need to notify the holder that their (current VC) is invalid and they need to take action to resolve

·         Issuers asking what if we make a mistake – (re-issue)

·         Holders having problems findin there vaccination VC

·         Many of the unresolved issues are governance/policy related (for which the “health authorities”) have not worked out the details

·         Policy providers are applying the brakes through in-grained bureaucracy to produce a perfect standard for their jurisdiction vs. rapidly evolving a common standard and “usable solution” in the short term.

·         Unclear on how to get VC and underlying data into the hands of holders, particularly as holders don’t have the technology and skills to manage their health data.

·         Data privacy is an issue across each of the implementers and users of the Issuer, Holder and Verifier roles. Lack of common understanding and agreement on how and who owns and controls the data

·         WHO standard will likely be adopted in the Global South (hemisphere)

·         GHP looking to paint a forward looking common picture, including interim solutions (iterate standards)

·         The number of players (and their levels of understanding/expertise and agreement with the current direction) alone makes consensus very difficult

·         Paper credentials have been getting consensus on interim solutions.

·         W3C and WHO are great candidates.

·         Affinidi is making a universal verifier application (https://www.affinidi.com/)

The importance and need for an Ethical framework/standards for the delivery technology development and implementations in healthcare. Apply the biomedical ethics that exist in healthcare to technology specifically SSI & user sovereignty.

"The physician must ... have two special objects in view with regard to disease, namely, to do good or to do no harm.”

Hippocrates, Epidemics (book I, section. 11) c. 410 BC

Autonomy – respect for the patient’s right to self-determination

Beneficence – the duty to ‘do good’.

Non-Maleficence – the duty to do ‘no harm’.

Justice – to treat all people equally and equitably for the benefit of society.

4 principles of biomedical ethics

No more in my everyday life have these four pillars been so important to me as they have been over the past year.

I clutched on to these while delivering care to patients gasping for breath, clinging onto life and some sadly succumbing to COVID-19.

* [...]

Do we need a Covid vaccine passport whether this is paper based or digital?

If there is or are contexts where a vaccine passport would be more beneficial than not, what are the technical principles, implementations and considerations that need to be met to ensure that they are implemented to comply with medical ethics and law?

After all this is personal health information and therefore should be treated as such.

What problem are we really trying to solve with a Covid Vaccine Passport, Covid Passport, ‘Covid’ credential, digital green certificate, or any other named health pass solution?

To do this there needs to be a basic understanding of this infectious disease, what tools we have currently to deal with it and address assumptions that have been made, many of which may change or are yet unknown such is the dynamic nature of a pandemic.

Reviving trust in safe travel is possible using digital identity and immunity credentials.

- Travel bans, quarantines and lockdowns have negatively impacted the travel industry
- Restoring trust and safety is paramount for travel, tourism and hospitality industries to recover
- Self-sovereign identity (SSI) built on distributed ledger technology (like blockchain) and cryptography could be used to reinvigorate travel by allowing individuals to easily and securely demonstrate their immunity status

Health passes, though, are much more flexible as they provide multiple options. They can still be used as proof of vaccination, if the user chooses to share their health information in this way.

But, importantly and in a crucial difference from vaccine passports, they can also be used to securely display a test result, such as a negative PCR or rapid antigen test (also known as lateral flow tests) today. Additionally, they are also future-proofed for options such as rapid antibody test results when those come into play on a large scale.

The advantage of a paper and ID card presentation ritual is that it is difficult to hack. So if we are going to improve the presentation with a single credential as above, privacy and security MUST be protected.

> Some states and other countries have started to pilot this approach, as have various industries like film and aviation. But, the inconsistent use of standards and varying implementations have already led to confusion and public concern.
