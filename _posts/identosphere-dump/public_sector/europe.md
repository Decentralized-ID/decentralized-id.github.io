Oskar van Deventer, a rockstar from TNO, presents:

> ways to build an SSI ecosystem and architecture together that is interoperable and technologically mature fit for society and funding opportunities for SSI projects through grants.

* [EU Data Governance Act](https://blog.meeco.me/eu-data-governance-act/) (Meeco)
  > We welcome the regulation as a needed common ground for clarifying the role of data intermediaries, building trust in these intermediaries and setting the direction for data governance, including the emergence of digital human rights.
> 
> In this context we offer the following suggestions:
> 1. Explicitly include individuals as active participants in the definitions [...]
> 2. Clarify the scope of the data sharing services (Art. 9 (2)) and extend it to include services that empower the data subject beyond compliance.
> 3. Foster the growth of intermediaries, which offer new technologies and have the greatest likelihood of success in Europe if supported by the Data Governance Act.
> 4. Open silos and implement soft infrastructure such as standards & open APIs to accelerate uptake and interoperability between data sharing services.
> 5. Foster eco-systems and demonstrate the value through practical use-cases.
> 6. Create a level playing field for sustainable data sharing by providing funding to pioneers at the forefront of developing data eco-systems

  > The [previous post](https://cyber.ee/blog/2021/03-23/) focused on identity as a single topic, pulling it away from the data exchange component where it has recently become muddled up. In terms of identity, self-sovereign identity (SSI) and traditional public key infrastructure (PKI) based offerings are, for the most part, on the same page.

* [NGI Forward SALON ON DIGITAL SOVERIGNTY IN eID-Solutions2: Self-sovereign, Centralised or Privatised?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3D1RxB7KK2x8Y)

Without a clear vision on identity, society will have no agency since the capability to produce future value (data) is not under regional, nor national, nor international regulated control.

Therefore it is important to have a good overview of what is happening in different parts of the world to see if we can not combine innovative solutions.

* [State of SSI in Europe and Necessity for Network-of-Networks (convened by Sovrin)](https://iiw.idcommons.net/11F/_State_of_SSI_in_Europe_and_Necessity_for_Network-of-Networks_(convened_by_Sovrin)) by Andre Kudra

1. [Andre] Introduction and the role of Sovrin Foundation around the topic of SSI
2. Focus of this session is around SSI in Europe (from business and related perspective)
3. Hyperledger Indy and Aries technology stack
4. ‘Network of networks’ which has been a key concept at the Sovrin Foundation
5. The topic is meant to be a conversation as an outline based on material information which can be shared publicly
6. EBSI is one of the funded projects from the EU
7. ESSIF is one of the projects in this portfolio - have issued a request for proposal for consulting (not in the network of networks topic but other areas)
8. Findy (Finland) - yet to go live. Has public and private partners.
9. Projects underway at [Spain](https://alastria.io/en/id-alastria/) and other member nations in EU
10. Substantial funding behind Indy based technology stack deployments are being seen
11. Germany has 3 major streams active in the identity space
12. Gov digital (for public sector)
13. ID Union - 2 fold - a project and a L1 Utility (as per the Trust over IP definition) project and Governance Framework; has started in 2020. Will be building a lot of use cases on Indy/Aries over a period of 3 years Includes EU member states and the 3 non EU nations. ID Union activity will have contributions to open source projects
14. Germany is running an SSI pilot based on the Aries framework. First use case — hotel check in for business travelers (two data types: ID; corporate billing address). German eID card will be used to generate a VC by issuing on behalf of the issuer of the eID card.
15. Mixed bag of projects and technologies which underline the topic/concept around ‘network of networks’. Organizations will come up with their networks and interoperability would be something that is inbuilt.
16. EU Commission has identified the necessity of making this happen. So no ‘one blockchain to rule them all’. A cooperative approach would be needed to get into NoN - tokenisation, IoT etc have been part of the requirements
17. 3 Sovrin member organizations have jointly created a position paper to address the necessity of this approach of NoN. This approach is endorsed by the Sovrin Foundation.
18. Universal resolver, multi-ledger wallet etc are key components. A side-project to make a tangible NoN experiment is on the cards.

* [Commission proposes a trusted and secure Digital Identity for all Europeans](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_2663)
  > However, there is no requirement for Member States to develop a national digital ID and to make it interoperable with the ones of other Member States, which leads to high discrepancies between countries. The current proposal will address these shortcomings by improving the effectiveness of the framework and extending its benefits to the private sector and to mobile use.

* [A trusted and secure European e-ID - Regulation](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/trusted-and-secure-european-e-id-regulation)

The legal instrument aims to provide, for cross-border use:

– access to highly secure and trustworthy electronic identity solutions,

– that public and private services can rely on trusted and secure digital identity solutions,

– that natural and legal persons are empowered to use digital identity solutions,

– that these solutions are linked to a variety of attributes and allow for the targeted sharing of identity data limited to the needs of the specific service requested,

– acceptance of qualified trust services in the EU and equal conditions for their provision.

## eIDAS
* [SSI eIDAS Legal Report – Ignacio Alamillo – Webinar 55](https://ssimeetup.org/introducing-ssi-eidas-legal-report-ignacio-alamillo-webinar-55/)
  > The European Commission developed the [SSI (Self-Sovereign Identity) eIDAS bridge](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/ssi-eidas-bridge), an ISA2 funded initiative, to promote eIDAS as a trust framework for the SSI ecosystem. It assists a VC (Verifiable Credential) issuer in the signing process, and helps the verifier to automate the identification of the organization behind the issuer’s DID (Decentralized Identifier). Simply by “crossing” the eIDAS Bridge, a Verifiable Credential can be proven trustworthy in the EU.
* [eIDAS and Self-Sovereign Identity](https://www.thedinglegroup.com/blog/2021/3/11/eidas-and-self-sovereign-identity) ([Video](https://vimeo.com/522501200) Dingle Group
  > Why then is eIDAS v1 not seen as a success? There are many reasons; from parts of the regulation that focused or constrained its use into the public sphere only, to the lack of total coverage across all of the EU. Likely the key missing piece was that the cultural climate was not yet ripe and the state of digital identity was really not ready. Too many technical problems were yet to be solved. Without these elements the realized state of eIDAS should not be unexpected. All this said, eIDAS v1 laid very important groundwork and created an environment to gather important learnings to allow eIDAS v2 to realize the hoped for levels of success and adoption.

* [Legal compliance and the involvement of governments](https://ssi-ambassador.medium.com/self-sovereign-identity-legal-compliance-and-the-involvement-of-governments-467acdd32e88) SSI Ambassador
  > It’s currently possible to be eIDAS compliant with SSI, leveraging one out of five scenarios described in the SSI eIDAS legal report by Dr. Ignacio Alamillo Domingo. Especially interesting is the SSI eIDAS bridge, which adds legal value to verified credentials with the use of electronic certificates and electronic seals. However, it’s also possible to derive national eIDs notified in eIDAS, which are eIDAS linked by issuing a verifiable credential with a qualified certificate according to the technical specification.

The SSI mandate service is a generic and holistic approach to provide and request mandates. Mandates are SSI credentials signed by the dependent that can be requested by either the dependent or authorized representative. These credentials can be used to prove to a verifier that the authorized representative is authorized to act for specific actions on behalf of the dependent.

The objective of the topic is to develop, implement and scale up the European Digital Identity framework, based on the revised eIDAS regulatory framework as well as the exchange of evidence as set out in article 14 the Single Digital Gateway Regulation. The broader objective of European Digital Identity is to improve citizen’s access to highly trusted and secure electronic identity means and trust services such as digital signatures, improve citizens’ possibilities to use them and improve their ability to control over sharing their personal identity data.

Since parties are autonomous, their trust is highly subjective. As a consequence, the idea of having 'trusted registries', 'trusted issuers' that do not take this subjectivity into account basically act as [(centralized) authorities](https://essif-lab.pages.grnet.gr/framework/docs/terms/authority), denying that parties are autonomous. While we acknowledge that such ideas (have a right to) exist, we do not follow them.

The uptake of eIDAS (facilitating cross-border acceptance of eIDs) is low relative to the technical capacity of states; [only 15 of the 27 Member States](https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/35274ac3-cd1b-11ea-adf7-01aa75ed71a1) able to fulfil the regulation’s requirements of accepting the eIDs of other Member States for public services.

The EU Commission did reflect on the effectiveness of the regulation in its [Impact Assessment](https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/35274ac3-cd1b-11ea-adf7-01aa75ed71a1), and is developing a revision of it. There are multiple revision options being discussed, but thus far, the preferred option would establish a framework that provides citizens with optional use of a personal digital wallet

Governmental entities act as important intermediaries for many transactions occurring in today´s society.

In the era of misinformation, digital fraud has become a challenge that is essential to address.

Governments and the societies they serve need technology capable of verifying the authenticity of the information they handle.

As we build the European regulatory framework, in the transfer from paper to digital, a key question arises: how to share official documents, called ‘evidences’ or ‘credentials’ in a way that can be trusted?

The new proposal will pivot on some of the more key issues that held back the original framework. For example, instead of enforcing a single, rigid ID that openly reveals everything about an individual indefinitely, the eIDAS 2.0 structure can now potentially employ a flexible, self-sovereign identity (SSI) that puts control of all identifying information entirely into the hands of the end-users they pertain to, in both public and private partnership frameworks.

Until now, the [eIDAS regulation](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/eur/2014/910/contents) has only focused on online identification. However, the new proposal – eIDAS 2.0 – aims to extend identity to the world of physical services which can be accessed from anywhere around the globe.

The web is increasingly more distributed, and with it, a new pattern of information sharing is emerging: Self Sovereign Information sharing, where citizens stay in control of their information by choosing what and when to disclose it, and to whom EBSI enables self-sovereign Citizen-to-Government (C2G) and C2B (Citizen-to-Business) privacy-preserving information sharing.
