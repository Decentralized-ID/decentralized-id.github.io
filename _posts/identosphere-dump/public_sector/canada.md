* [Canadian Government: User-Centric Verifiable Digital Credentials Challenge](https://github.com/canada-ca/ucvdcc)
  > This challenge is seeking a portable secure digital credentials (self-sovereign identity) solution held by individuals that can be independently, cryptographically and rapidly verified using emerging distributed ledger standards and an approach that may give rise to a global digital verification platform.

* [Ontario’s Digital ID: Technology and standards](https://www.ontario.ca/page/ontarios-digital-id-technology-and-standards)

Ontario’s Digital ID will use self-sovereign identity because it gives the holder control over the credentials in their wallet. In addition, we are layering on these extra privacy-preserving features:

- Consent – The verifier must ask you to approve their request to confirm your credentials.
- Data minimization – The verifier can only access what they need to confirm you are eligible for their service. For example, if you need to prove that you are old enough to buy a lottery ticket, the store clerk would only know that you are 18 or older – not your actual age, birth date or anything else about you.
- Anonymity – Your credentials are not tracked or traced.

Sloan invoked the specter of China while discussing the petition, suggesting that any digital identity program would be akin to a [social credit program](https://findbiometrics.com/china-jaywalkers-biometric-surveillance-503275/) that gives the government too much control over the personal lives of its citizens.

* [British Columbia OrgBook – ‘Tell Us Once’ via Blockchain and Self-Sovereign Identity](https://digitalcanada.io/bc-orgbook-tell-us-once/)

Canada is beginning to develop their own version of a “[Tell Us Once](https://digitalcanada.io/tell-us-once-legislation/)” Digital Identity policy, an approach pioneered in Europe by the likes of Estonia.

This is a policy where having provided your data to one government agency, you’ll never be asked for it again from another, defined explicitly through legislation.
