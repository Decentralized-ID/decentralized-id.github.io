  > from the plethora of federal privacy bills put forward, there are three standouts:

- [Consumer Online Privacy Rights Act](https://www.cantwell.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/COPRA%2520Bill%2520Text.pdf) (COPRA) (Democrats) – Sponsored in November 2019 by Democratic Senator Maria Cantwell of Washington, this bill is [considered by some](https://www.darkreading.com/endpoint/what-a-federal-data-privacy-law-would-mean-for-consumers/a/d-id/1340433) to be “GDPR-esque” and more consumer than business friendly.
- Setting an American Framework to Ensure Data Access, Transparency and Accountable Ability Act ([SAFE DATA Act](https://www.commerce.senate.gov/services/files/BD190421-F67C-4E37-A25E-5D522B1053C7)) (GOP) – Combining three previous bills, the SAFE DATA Act is [considered by some](https://www.darkreading.com/endpoint/what-a-federal-data-privacy-law-would-mean-for-consumers/a/d-id/1340433) as more “business friendly”.
- [Information Transparency and Personal Data Control Act](https://delbene.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID%3D2740) – Re-introduced by Congresswoman Suzan DelBene (WA-01) for the fourth time (the latest on March 10, 2021), [this bill](https://delbene.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID%3D2740) “… protects personal information including data relating to financial, health, genetic, biometric, geolocation, sexual orientation, citizenship and immigration status, Social Security Numbers, and religious beliefs. It also keeps information about children under 13 years of age safe. ”Beyond this it requires businesses to write their privacy policies in simple language.“

We must promote access to safe and affordable financial services.  Many Americans are underbanked and the costs of cross-border money transfers and payments are high.  The United States has a strong interest in promoting responsible innovation that expands equitable access to financial services, particularly for those Americans underserved by the traditional banking system, including by making investments and domestic and cross-border funds transfers and payments cheaper, faster, and safer, and by promoting greater and more cost-efficient access to financial products and services.  The United States also has an interest in ensuring that the benefits of financial innovation are enjoyed equitably by all Americans and that any disparate impacts of financial innovation are mitigated.
