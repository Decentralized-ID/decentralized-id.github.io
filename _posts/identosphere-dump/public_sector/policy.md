a framework that Digital Identity Ecosystem Participants can use to assess the degree to which the digital wallets that are part of their respective ecosystems accomplish the following:

1. Provide Citizens and Consumers with a Digital Identity Wallet that complies with the human rights principles of preserving people’s privacy and control over their information.
2. Introduces a consistent identity metaphor and consent-driven automated experience across all Ecosystem Participants to reduce impact on users caused by Digital Transformation.
3. Contribute to a stable infrastructure with longevity and world-wide interoperability by adopting and supporting relevant standards as appropriate (e.g., W3C Standards for Verifiable Credentials and DIDs).
4. Counter cyber vulnerability and extortion by enabling Service Providers to incrementally replace existing login mechanisms, some of which may be exploitable, without suffering negative impact to business.
5. Establish an environment of trust within which the wallet’s owner can interact with other Ecosystem Participants such as Issuers, Verifiers, and other Relying Parties.

* [approved another on Wednesday](https://www.gov.ca.gov/2022/09/28/governor-newsom-issues-legislative-update-9-28-22/) that instructs county records offices to [allow for the use of blockchain technology](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id%3D202120220SB786) and verifiable credentials. The technology would be established in the distribution of birth, death and marriage records, allowing PDFs to be sent immediately rather than using a typical 10-day postal delivery.

## Policy

* [6 months of KI Identity Assurance in the UK](https://kantarainitiative.org/2022/09/29/6-months-of-ki-identity-assurance-in-the-uk/) Kantara Initiative

We believe it is vital that certification bodies work with DCMS and UKAS in a spirit of partnership – bringing together the cumulative value of dozens of great minds! To this end, we have  been encouraged by the proactive approach of DCMS in creating forums where the 5 certification bodies can discuss ideas and feedback on the program in action.

* [2 Signs the US is Getting Tougher on Data Privacy Regulation](https://anonyome.com/2022/09/2-signs-the-us-is-getting-tougher-on-data-privacy-regulation/) Anonyme

I know almost everyone can probably find something that they wished were different in the bill. On the other hand, I do think we have a band-aid for the American people who are just fed up with the lack of privacy online
* [Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights - MAKING AUTOMATED SYSTEMS WORK FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/ai-bill-of-rights/) Whitehouse.Gov

Responding to the experiences of the American public, and informed by insights from researchers, technologists, advocates, journalists, and policymakers, this framework is accompanied by From Principles to Practice—a handbook for anyone seeking to incorporate these protections into policy and practice

* [California Legalizes Blockchain-based Vital Records](https://mobileidworld.com/california-legalizes-blockchain-based-vital-records-410031/) MobileDataWorld

As [an abstract of the bill](https://trackbill.com/bill/california-senate-bill-786-county-birth-death-and-marriage-records-blockchain/2043852/) explains, while existing law requires such records “to contain certain information and to be printed on chemically sensitized security paper, as specified,” the new legislation enables a county recorder to, upon request, issue a birth, death, or marriage record “by means of verifiable credential, as defined, using blockchain technology, defined as a decentralized data system, in which the data stored is mathematically verifiable, that uses distributed ledgers or databases to store specialized data in the permanent order of transactions recorded.”

* [A critical fork in the data road?](https://medium.com/mydex/a-critical-fork-in-the-data-road-1eb29c5a42a8) MyData

Is the EU discussion about data portability missing a key point?

In its discussion of data portability the EU rightly recognises the economic importance of this issue, stressing that “market imbalances arising from the concentration of data restricts competition, increases market entry barriers and diminishes wider data access and use.”

## Verifiable Credentials
* [Verifiable Credentials: Mapping to a Generic Policy Terminology](https://trbouma.medium.com/verifiable-credentials-mapping-to-a-generic-policy-terminology-bce84a039bb)
  > Why is this useful? When writing policy, you need a succinct model which is clear enough for subsequent interpretation. To do this, you need conceptual buckets to drop things into. Yes, this model is likely to change, but it’s my best and latest crack at it to synthesize the complex world of digital credentials with an abstraction that might be useful to help us align existing solutions while adopting exciting new capabilities.
* [VCs Policy Committeee (California) – Participate in passing legislation to create a California Trust Framework!](https://iiw.idcommons.net/21B/_(California)_Verifiable_Credentials_Policy_Committeee_-_Come_learn_about_how_participate_in_passing_legislation_to_crete_a_California_Trust_Framework!) by Kaliya Young, Ally Medina [Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1VyxmWan3qbxynxhKvw1CHhWZINiPRF9gjeqSCSDh1MY/edit?usp%3Dsharing)
  > discussed how the Blockchain Advocacy Coalition’s sponsorship of [AB 2004](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id%3D201920200AB2004) pushed verifiable credentials into mainstream political discourse and how companies can help us shape public policy and government pilot programs of Verifiable Credential technology.

  > We are planning on working with legislators to introduce a bill that creates a California Trust Framework and lays the groundwork for use of the technology in the public and private sector.
