  > There is a lot of diversity in the category of future patent problems. Someone who was contributing without declaring that they hold a patent related to the work can claim they had a patent later (years after the specification is finished) and seek payment from everyone using/implementing the standard, claiming licensing rights or even lost revenue on ideas they legally own.

What most people want but don’t have the terms to describe is respectful digital relationships. In the same way there is an unspoken code for respectful behavior in physical-realm relationships, this same type of behavior is just as essential when engaging with an online service or website.

  > How data is governed can be thought of along several lines of activity: legislating privacy and data use, regulating content, using antitrust laws to dilute data monopolies, self-regulating by the tech giants, regulating digital trade, addressing intellectual property rights (IPR) infringement, assuring cybersecurity, and practicing cyber diplomacy. Of these, antitrust, regulation, and privacy are most immediately in the spotlight, and are the focus of this commentary, but it will also touch briefly on the connections with other issues.

End-to-end messaging encryption is a domain where mistakes matter. The current draft of the DMA imposes a tight deadline for interoperability to begin (on the reasonable assumption that Big Tech monopolists will drag their feet otherwise) and this is not a job you want to rush.

* [Centre’s Response to Australian Treasury](https://www.centre.io/blog/centres-response-to-australian-treasury) Centre

In this letter, we focus on a couple of issues that would be beneficial in expanding the Australian regulatory frameworks to include crypto assets. Furthermore, our comments pertain specifically to fiat-backed stablecoins, which are backed on a 1:1 basis by reserve assets, such as bank deposits and short-term government bonds.



* [2022 GDF Report CRYPTOASSETS AND SANCTIONS COMPLIANCE A PRIMER](https://www.gdf.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Cryptoassets-and-Sanctions-Compliance-Report-Final-1.pdf?mc_cid%3D5d688e0647%26mc_eid%3Dbebf526fc7) GDF

There is a common misconception that cryptoassets provide a ready-made avenue for sanctions evasion because they sit outside the regulatory and legal perimeter. In fact, sanctions authorities in many jurisdictions have ensured that relevant legal and regulatory requirements apply comprehensively to activity conducted in cryptoassets.

The plan also signals that Beijing will take a more active role in handling the personal data generated by these platforms. Some of the directives outlined in the plan require any user-facing aspect of the digital human industry to be subject to rules that protect information about and generated by platform users, while also treating user data as a resource to be traded on the country’s new data exchanges.

We believe it is vital that certification bodies work with DCMS and UKAS in a spirit of partnership – bringing together the cumulative value of dozens of great minds! To this end, we have  been encouraged by the proactive approach of DCMS in creating forums where the 5 certification bodies can discuss ideas and feedback on the program in action.

  > Why is this useful? When writing policy, you need a succinct model which is clear enough for subsequent interpretation. To do this, you need conceptual buckets to drop things into. Yes, this model is likely to change, but it’s my best and latest crack at it to synthesize the complex world of digital credentials with an abstraction that might be useful to help us align existing solutions while adopting exciting new capabilities.

* […]

It may be time for us to explain Zero-Trust Architecture relationship to

VCs and DIDs. My not-so-hidden agenda includes priority for considering

authorization and delegation in our protocol work but our diverse community of security experts will surely make this a much broader discussion.

Sec. 3.  Modernizing Federal Government Cybersecurity.

(a)  To keep pace with today’s dynamic and increasingly sophisticated cyber threat environment, the Federal Govern>ment must take decisive steps to modernize its approach to cybersecurity, including by increasing the Federal Government’s visibility into threats, while protecting privacy and civil liberties.  The Federal Government must adopt security best practices; advance toward Zero Trust Architecture; accelerate movement to secure cloud services, including Software as a Service (SaaS), Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), and Platform as a Service (PaaS); centralize and streamline access to cybersecurity data to drive analytics for identifying and managing cybersecurity risks; and invest in both technology and personnel to match these modernization goals.
