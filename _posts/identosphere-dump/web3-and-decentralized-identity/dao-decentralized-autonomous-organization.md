- DAO migration from voting to more collaborative tools but look more like an elance platform than a government
- Not very bizarre, Oligarchy
- Bizarre phenomenon of producers of money not having money
- Predictable phenomenon of tech platforms that have no market because we threw so much money at it.
- Value-backed protocols and ambitiousness of Holo, in particular the interesting model of having an open source project owning a for-profit company
- Moved into the idea of flows rather than objects which
- Reputation as a form of communication

Crypto projects that use DAO:

- DASH
- MakerDAO / DAI
