## Essence of Decentralized Identity

The essence of Decentralized-ID is in creating open standards for a privacy preserving internet-wide identity layer — not owned by any one particular organization, but interoperable between all.

### Background
It's impossible to have a conversation about decentralized-id without discussing blockchain, self sovereign identity, standardization, frameworks, and government bodies.

* Cryptographers, privacy advocates and digital identity enthusiasts [laid the foundation](/history/) by deeply considering the privacy implications of identification practices in the electronic world.
  * [Self Sovereign Identity principles emerged]({% link _posts/topics/2018-12-22-characteristics-principles.md %}) from their work, gathering momentum as the digital age began to settle in.* The European Union's GDPR enlarged the global conversation around digital privacy practices, lending much weight to the SSI credo.
* The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have also fueled efforts towards a global and widely accessible identity solution.
* Satoshi Nakamoto released [Bitcoin](https://bitcoinfo.xyz), proving the concept of digital scarcity in the form of a decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) currency, inspiring leaders in every industry to integrate it's features to their business models.
* At the same time, [Decentralized web](https://sourcecrypto.pub/decentralized-web/) and P2P technologists have also lent strength to Decentralized Identity efforts.
* Collectively arrived at solutions are trending towards congruence with the spirit of innovation, privacy concerns, and compliance within the evolving global regulatory landscape.

## Getting Started with Decentralized, Self Sovereign, Digital Identity

  > The technical name for the model at work here is called the Direct Presentation model. A credential is issued, and then held for a long period of time with intermittent voluntary presentations to many different verifiers. To put that back into our example, my auto club issues me a card, which I hold in my wallet for years (maybe decades!), and I might choose to show that card to a garage when I need a tow, or possibly to a store to get a discount.

  > Karyl and Juan revisited their slide deck from #IIW30 to give an overview of decentralized identity first as a "philosophy" at the confluence of ideological currents (Juan), and then as a set of specific emerging technologies which unlocks new mental models and business models that are still coming into focus sector by sector (Karyl). There follows a brief overview of educational resources, including some products of DIF's recent educational "content sprint," and a wide-ranging Q&A including podcast recommendations and how to navigate open standards for the first time.  The slides are here, in downloadable and hyperlinked PDF form:
* [What Is Self-Sovereign Identity?](https://trinsic.id/what-is-self-sovereign-identity/) 2020-04-28 Trinsic
  > Self-sovereign identity is the marriage of real identity with the digital world that will ultimately make people’s lives better.² It’s still in its infancy, and there is a long road ahead to truly make digital identity as legitimate and nuanced as a real-world identity.
* [Explaining SSI to C-suite executives, and anyone else for that matter – John Phillips](https://ssimeetup.org/explaining-ssi-c-suite-executives-anyone-else-john-phillips-webinar-48/) 2020-02-18 SSIMeetup
  > John Phillips from 460degrees in Australia has been exploring with his team for more than two years for a way to describe Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) that was easy to understand. We think he has found a good method to make SSI easy to understand for any C-suite executive and business people that goes beyond the technology.
* [The Need for Good Digital ID is Universal](https://id2020.org/digital-identity) 2019-02-26 ID2020 Foundation
  > The ability to prove who you are is a fundamental and universal human right. Because we live in a digital era, we need a trusted and reliable way to do that both in the physical world and online.
* [The Laws of Identity](http://www.windley.com/archives/2019/01/the_laws_of_identity.shtml) 2019-01 Phil Windley
  > The Internet was created without any way to identify the people who used it. The Internet was a network of machines. Consequently, all the identity in Internet protocols is designed to identify machines and services. People used the Internet through some institution (their company or university) and were part of that institution's administrative identity system. This can still be seen in the format of email addresses that identify both recipient and sender as someone@someplace. As the Internet grew to include people who weren't formally associated with an institution, every Web site and service created their own administrative identity domains. The result is the fractured plethora of identifiers, policies, and user experiences that constitute digital identity in 2019.

  > This lack of secure, portable, user-controlled identity has some dire consequences. It means that a person’s identity and personal data only exists within the context of each specific website or application he or she uses. Stop using the site or application and the person’s digital existence is meaningless. And a user’s control over their identity and data must be exerted on a site-by-site, app-by-app basis.
* [The Rising Tide of Decentralized Identity](https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/the-rising-tide-of-decentralized-identity-2e163e4ec663) 2017-10-11 Decentralized Identity Foundation
  > Creating a unified decentralized identity ecosystem requires addressing a set of fundamental user needs and technical challenges:
  > - Enabling registration of self-sovereign identifiers that no provider owns or controls.
  > - The ability to lookup and discover identifiers and data across decentralized systems.
  > - Providing a mechanism for users to securely store sensitive identity data, and enabling them to precisely control what is shared with others.
* [The Case for Decentralized Identity](https://www.windley.com/archives/2017/08/the_case_for_decentralized_identity.shtml) 2017-08 Phil Windley
  > We cannot decentralize many interesting systems without also decentralizing the identity systems upon which they rely. We're finally in a position to create truly decentralized systems for digital identity.
* [The Path to Self-Sovereign Identity](https://github.com/ChristopherA/self-sovereign-identity/blob/master/ThePathToSelf-SovereignIdentity.md) 2017-03-01 Christopher Allen
  > Self-sovereign identity is the next step beyond user-centric identity and that means it begins at the same place: the user must be central to the administration of identity. That requires not just the interoperability of a user’s identity across multiple locations, with the user’s consent, but also true user control of that digital identity, creating user autonomy. To accomplish this, a self-sovereign identity must be transportable; it can’t be locked down to one site or locale.

  > Abstract The desire for increased control over our identity has catapulted the idea of “self‐sovereign identity” into the forefront of digital identity innovation, yet the term lacks a rigorous definition beyond specific technical implementations1. This paper explores what self‐sovereign identity means independent of technology: what people need from independent identity capabilities. I want to understand how such a system enables both individuals whose identities are in play (subjects), as well as those who use those “identities” to correlate interactions across contexts (observers). I start with grounding individual sovereignty in the Enlightenment and identity in its core function of correlation, then propose core characteristics of a self‐sovereign identity system. My eventual goal is to model the technology‐independent requirements of a self‐sovereign solution suitable for realizing UN Sustainable Development Goal 16.9: “Providing every last person on the planet with a legal identity by 2030.”

## Digital Identity 101
If you're looking to freshen up on your digital identity fundamentals, the following resources will be a good place to start.

* [Difference Between Authentication and Authorization](https://www.beyondtrust.com/blog/entry/understanding-authentication-vs-authorization) 2020-10-19 Beyond Trust
  > What is the difference between authentication (authN) versus authorization (authZ)? While these two fundamental security terms are often confused with each other, the only real similarity is they both begin with the letter “A” and are linked by an account. In concept, one verifies the account (authentication) and the other sanctions (authorization) the account to perform a task. Because these terms are so fundamental, it’s crucial to understand the difference between them, and the implications for each when the concepts are blended

  > Identity and Access Management (IAM), also called identity management, refers to the IT security discipline, framework, and solutions for managing digital identities. Identity management encompasses the provisioning and de-provisioning of identities, securing and authentication of identities, and the authorization to access resources and/or perform certain actions. While a person (user) has only one singular digital identity, they may have many different accounts representing them. Each account can have different access controls, both per resource and per context.

  > The Sapir–Whorf Hypothesis, also known as the principle of linguistic relativity, posits that language constructs our reality and worldview. While the hypothesis has been contested over the years, language is unarguably fundamental to the models of the world we build in our heads — and in our systems.
