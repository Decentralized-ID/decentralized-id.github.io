## California

  > Blockchain technology has captured the attention of individuals far beyond the circles of computer scientists and cryptocurrency enthusiasts that initially sparked its development. The themes of distributed authority, decentralized governance, self-sovereign identity, and data privacy appeal to those who favor reducing hierarchy and increasing personal agency. The field has evolved in recent years to explore applications in the public sector and in private enterprise where regulation is a consideration.

  > AB 2004 (Calderon, Whittier) marked the first time verifiable credentials saw legislative debate. The bill to allow the use of verifiable credentials for covid-19 test results and other medical records made it through both houses with bipartisan support. Due to state budget restraints, it was ultimately vetoed, however the concept gained significant legislative momentum quickly. We are actively working on our strategy for verifiable credentials policy next year.

  > August 31, 2017 (Chicago/Salt Lake City) — Today the Illinois Blockchain Initiative announced its partnership with self-sovereign identity solutions leader Evernym, leveraging distributed ledger technology to provide secure digital identity solutions. The concept will augment work from the W3C’s Verifiable Claims Task Force and use the Sovrin Foundation’s distributed identity ledger to create a secure, “self-sovereign” identity for Illinois citizens during the birth registration process.
