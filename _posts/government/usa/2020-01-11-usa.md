  > One key aspect outlined in Section 4 of the Executive Order (EO) is securing the software supply chain. At issue here is the reality that the U.S. federal government—like nearly any other organization on the planet that uses computer technology in any form—relies on not just one but numerous types of software to process data and run operational equipment.

  > 
  > (a)  To keep pace with today’s dynamic and increasingly sophisticated cyber threat environment, the Federal Government must take decisive steps to modernize its approach to cybersecurity, including by increasing the Federal Government’s visibility into threats, while protecting privacy and civil liberties.  The Federal Government must adopt security best practices; advance toward Zero Trust Architecture; accelerate movement to secure cloud services, including Software as a Service (SaaS), Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), and Platform as a Service (PaaS); centralize and streamline access to cybersecurity data to drive analytics for identifying and managing cybersecurity risks; and invest in both technology and personnel to match these modernization goals.

  > The Senators’ complaints stem from comments that ID.me and CEO Blake Hall made about the nature of its facial recognition system. More specifically, they call attention to statements and a blog post in which Hall claimed that his company only performs one-to-one matching to compare a new selfie to an image on a photo ID during the identity verification process. One-to-one matching is considered to be both more accurate and more secure than alternative one-to-many solutions, since the user’s image is never cross-referenced against a larger database.

  > We had previously written about an FTC proposed consent order that would prohibit a company from perpetual retention of personal health information.  On March 2, 2023, the FTC announced a complaint and proposed consent with BetterHelp, Inc. that would prohibit the company from perpetual retention of personal information—a broader category.   Also unlike the previous matter, the FTC did not cite to the health breach notification requirements, but instead included claims only under Section 5  of the FTC Act.  Under the proposed consent, BetterHelp would pay $7.8 million, which the FTC may use for consumer redress.  In the Matter of BetterHelp, Inc., FTC File No. 2023169 (Mar. 2, 2023).

  > We must promote access to safe and affordable financial services.  Many Americans are underbanked and the costs of cross-border money transfers and payments are high.  The United States has a strong interest in promoting responsible innovation that expands equitable access to financial services, particularly for those Americans underserved by the traditional banking system, including by making investments and domestic and cross-border funds transfers and payments cheaper, faster, and safer, and by promoting greater and more cost-efficient access to financial products and services.  The United States also has an interest in ensuring that the benefits of financial innovation are enjoyed equitably by all Americans and that any disparate impacts of financial innovation are mitigated.

Moreover, the treasury has reportedly said it would provide clarifying guidance after the bill is passed to allow exemptions to firms that do not actually operate as brokers. The reported clarification from the Treasury is potentially a welcome sign that would improve the morale of the crypto community regarding the proposed bill.

  > Principal Authority focuses not just on a single person’s authority to act digitally, but also on their ability to delegate to and require duties from other entities. In other words, these peer-to-peer relationships works within the context of a state who recognizes the concept of Principal Authority. Thus the use of Principal Authority to empower Self-Sovereign Identity provides a legal foothold for many of the original 10 #SSI principles. It also suggests five additional duties that are generally defined under the Laws of Agency to be due from agents to Principals.
