  > USCIS make public announcement about their plants to use Verifiable Credentials for Immigration credentials
  > 
  > Very interesting #FedID presentation on @USCIS plans for digital immigration credentials. Looking to use the @w3c Verifiable Credentials standard - this may be the first use of VCs at scale in the US government.
* [Great to see USCIS speaking publicly at the the #FedID Conference last week](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/aniljohn_fedid-activity-6974431929118924800-oOu7?trk=public_profile_like_view)  2022-10

  > There are so many things that build into your identity and you’ll take all this information and it’ll be issued to you through a decentralized ID. These wallets will have layers of protection that protect your information, like your Social Security number or your birth certificate, or your marriage license.  You’ll have this extra layer of protection when you need to prove your identity, and this could apply to a passport as well.

  > One key aspect outlined in Section 4 of the Executive Order (EO) is securing the software supply chain. At issue here is the reality that the U.S. federal government—like nearly any other organization on the planet that uses computer technology in any form—relies on not just one but numerous types of software to process data and run operational equipment.

  > We must promote access to safe and affordable financial services.  Many Americans are underbanked and the costs of cross-border money transfers and payments are high.  The United States has a strong interest in promoting responsible innovation that expands equitable access to financial services, particularly for those Americans underserved by the traditional banking system, including by making investments and domestic and cross-border funds transfers and payments cheaper, faster, and safer, and by promoting greater and more cost-efficient access to financial products and services.  The United States also has an interest in ensuring that the benefits of financial innovation are enjoyed equitably by all Americans and that any disparate impacts of financial innovation are mitigated.

    > Sponsored in November 2019 by Democratic Senator Maria Cantwell of Washington, this bill is [considered by some](https://www.darkreading.com/endpoint/what-a-federal-data-privacy-law-would-mean-for-consumers/a/d-id/1340433) to be “GDPR-esque” and more consumer than business friendly.

    > Combining three previous bills, the SAFE DATA Act is [considered by some](https://www.darkreading.com/endpoint/what-a-federal-data-privacy-law-would-mean-for-consumers/a/d-id/1340433) as more “business friendly”.
  - [Information Transparency and Personal Data Control Act](https://delbene.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=2740) – 
    > Re-introduced by Congresswoman Suzan DelBene (WA-01) for the fourth time (the latest on March 10, 2021), [this bill](https://delbene.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=2740) “… protects personal information including data relating to financial, health, genetic, biometric, geolocation, sexual orientation, citizenship and immigration status, Social Security Numbers, and religious beliefs. It also keeps information about children under 13 years of age safe. ”Beyond this it requires businesses to write their privacy policies in simple language.“

## Biometrics

  > We had previously written about an FTC proposed consent order that would prohibit a company from perpetual retention of personal health information.  On March 2, 2023, the FTC announced a complaint and proposed consent with BetterHelp, Inc. that would prohibit the company from perpetual retention of personal information—a broader category.   Also unlike the previous matter, the FTC did not cite to the health breach notification requirements, but instead included claims only under Section 5  of the FTC Act.  Under the proposed consent, BetterHelp would pay $7.8 million, which the FTC may use for consumer redress.  In the Matter of BetterHelp, Inc., FTC File No. 2023169 (Mar. 2, 2023).

  > There is a very real risk that because two companies control the mobile handset operating systems – Apple and Google – the will work to limit access to the APIs within the phone preventing any wallets created by other companies working well.  
  > 
  > This doesn’t have to happen and the risk of it happening will be reduced if the FTC gets involved to ensure a level playing field for wallet makers – and ensuring consumers will have a choice of who they trust with the sensitive data about who they transact with across the digital world. Thank you. 


## Crypto

  > Reports state that an amendment to the bill is unlikely when it is discussed during the autumn session. Moreover, the treasury has reportedly said it would provide clarifying guidance after the bill is passed to allow exemptions to firms that do not actually operate as brokers. The reported clarification from the Treasury is potentially a welcome sign that would improve the morale of the crypto community regarding the proposed bill.

  > Blockchain technology has captured the attention of individuals far beyond the circles of computer scientists and cryptocurrency enthusiasts that initially sparked its development. The themes of distributed authority, decentralized governance, self-sovereign identity, and data privacy appeal to those who favor reducing hierarchy and increasing personal agency. The field has evolved in recent years to explore applications in the public sector and in private enterprise where regulation is a consideration.

  > AB 2004 (Calderon, Whittier) marked the first time verifiable credentials saw legislative debate. The bill to allow the use of verifiable credentials for covid-19 test results and other medical records made it through both houses with bipartisan support. Due to state budget restraints, it was ultimately vetoed, however the concept gained significant legislative momentum quickly. We are actively working on our strategy for verifiable credentials policy next year.
