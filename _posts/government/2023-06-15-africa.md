* [Video] [What Is a Blockchain (SSI) Self-Sovereign Identity?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uq0MQH4fAgc&t=3s) Blockchain Africa Conference 2022
  > What is the value of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) for organisations and citizens? What are the current initiatives and traction of SSI in South Africa? What are the economic benefits and the hurdles to SSI adoption in South Africa?
* [Digital identity can transform Africa’s economic landscape](https://www.globalbusinessoutlook.com/digital-identity-can-transform-africas-economic-landscape/) 2021-10-25 Global Business Outlook
  > In 2018, I was trying to open a bank account in my home town of Mutare, Zimbabwe, having just come back from the 1st world, I was under the impression it would take me at most 30 mins to an hour. I immediately realised I couldn’t provide most of the requirements such as my ‘Proof of Residence’ and many more. It turns out it took weeks and months for some to finish the entire process.

  > This builds on four years of Absa’s work with BankServ, other banks and multiple local and global forums, to set up an industry-wide governance framework for self-sovereign identity, including collaboration with the South African International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO) to develop documentation that covers the standards for SSDI management.

  > Much like cell phone technology and the internet, the true power of SSDI will only be unleashed when it is embedded across all sectors of society, from education and medical care to telecommunications and retail. And that will require all role players – government bodies, regulators, service providers, public and private agencies – to take up the SSDI baton and become part of the change.

  > Three stages have been identified as necessities to accomplish the development of this system before opening it further beyond the pan-African worldwide community. The three stages are defined by systems that allow for biometric/demographic registration (stage 1), interoperability and security hardening (stage 2), and biometric modality data analysis/organization/association (stage 3).

  > Since the launch of Kiva Protocol, Davie says global regulators have made significant progress in terms of how they are considering digital identity and eKYC verifications. He sees a global movement towards user-owned and -controlled data, better privacy, and more universal access
  > *[...]*
  > As of today, Kiva is focusing on building additional ecosystem applications and services to make it easier for all stakeholders to access and use Kiva Protocol. Much of this is being contributed upstream into the Hyperledger Indy and Aires projects, with the remaining components hosted in Kiva’s repository.

    > Kiva, a US-based nonprofit organization focused on financial inclusion, has built Kiva Protocol to help enable universal financial access. In 2019, Sierra Leone, a West African nation of about 7 million, launched the National Digital Identity Platform (NDIP) that used Kiva Protocol to enable fast, cheap, and secure identity verification for its citizens.

* [Video] [Panel: Self-Sovereign Identity for Economic Empowerment: Lessons from Africa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpLzQk9fmnM) 2021-06-14 HGF2021 
  > Self-sovereign identity (SSI) is a movement that claims digital identity should be just as legitimate and nuanced as a person’s human identity, while being accessible to all, privacy-preserving, and not reliant on a single government or corporation. The worldwide adoption of SSI has the potential to increase people's access to goods and services, including for disadvantaged individuals that do not have a government ID. Kiva, DIDx, and Farmer Connect are all using SSI backed by Hyperledger Aries/Indy to economically empower people in Africa. The panellists will specifically focus on the successes and obstacles that each of them have faced in helping to bring SSI to Africa. The speakers will share insights from each of their respective projects which are diverse in industry and use case.

  > Hoskinson, whose ultimate ambition is to build a [national ID system for Ethiopia](https://www.yahoo.com/now/cardano-plans-build-national-id-073828481.html), recently struck a deal with Ethiopia’s Ministry of Education for a blockchain-based ID pilot involving five million secondary school students. As he [describes](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/04/28/decentralized-identity-on-the-blockchain-is-the-key-to-iohks-vision-for-africa/) it, “Every one of these students will have a digital identity — a DID. That DID carries with it information — metadata — that will travel with them throughout their academic life, and follow them into the economic world.”
