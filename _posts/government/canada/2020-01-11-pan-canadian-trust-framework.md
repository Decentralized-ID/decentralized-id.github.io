## Background

* [Looking Ahead in 2020](https://medium.com/@trbouma/looking-ahead-in-2020-830afa372878)
  > I believe it will be a breakout year for digital identity, and for the underlying technical infrastructure that we need to achieve our goals. I see the work progressing on two fronts: 1) Pan-Canadian Trust Framework, and, 2) Verifiable Credentials/Decentralized Identifiers Deployment.
* [Public Sector Profile of the Pan-Canadian Trust Framework Version 1.0 Recommendation Draft](https://medium.com/@trbouma/public-sector-profile-of-the-pan-canadian-trust-framework-version-1-0-4baf8ff0cfa0) — Now [available on GitHub](https://canada-ca.github.io/PCTF-CCP/)
  > The public sector profile of the PCTF reflects:
  > - Evolution of the Identity Management Sub-Committee (IMSC) efforts. 
  > - The Need to Apply the PCTF for Assessments. 
  > - Policy Alignment.
* [IMSC Pan-Canadian Trust Framework Executive Summary](https://medium.com/@trbouma/imsc-pan-canadian-trust-framework-executive-summary-5c89a72e06b5)
  > This [document](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Xmjh8QJZKWmRkaTtE2f43ISntD7jE6D5) describes Version 1.0 of the IMSC Pan-Canadian Trust Framework (PCTF). This framework is the next major step after the 2016 publication of the Pan-Canadian Trust Framework Overview by the Digital Identification and Authentication Council of Canada (DIACC), in collaboration with the Canadian public sector Identity Management Sub-Committee (IMSC) of the Joint Councils (JC).

* [The Pan-Canadian Trust Framework Using Prolog](https://medium.com/@trbouma/the-pan-canadian-trust-framework-using-prolog-e62ffa911ff5)
  > A ‘declarative framework’ (such as [Prolog](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/prolog-an-introduction/)) focuses on the ‘what’ needs to be done, satisfied, relied on (i.e., proven to be true) versus ‘how to do it.’ In our case, with the Pan-Canadian Trust Framework (PCTF), it’s the question of ‘Can we rely on or accept a digital identity originating from a province or territory?’
* [Pan-Canadian Trust Framework - Tim Bouma](https://medium.com/@trbouma/pan-canadian-trust-framework-eb65eac6c683)
  > The Pan-Canadian Trust Framework is how we will formalize the approval and acceptance of a “trusted digital identity.”
