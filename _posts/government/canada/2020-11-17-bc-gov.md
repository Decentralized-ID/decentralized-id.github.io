## Verifiable Organizations Network

* [VonX](https://vonx.io/) - Global digital trust for organizations
  > The Verifiable Organizations Network (VON) is a community effort to establish a better way to find, issue, store and share trustworthy data about organizations—locally and around the globe. Community partners are using jointly developed software components to enable the digitization of government-issued public credentials—registrations, permits, and licenses. Currently, VON components are based on Hyperledger Indy distributed ledger technology.

  > VON's founding members are governments who are, by law, trusted issuers of data about organizations. The Province of British Columbia, Province of Ontario and the Government of Canada have come together to create the initial services needed to establish VON.
  >
  > VON's founders have delivered new Indy-based open source components which form VON's backbone. TheOrgBook is a publicly accessible repository of verifiable claims about organizations. VON-X enables services to verify and issue credentials. 
* [bcgov/TheOrgBook](https://github.com/bcgov/TheOrgBook) - A public repository of verifiable claims about organizations. A key component of the Verifiable Organization Network.
  > OrgBook BC is a deployment of an underlying software component called a Verifiable Credential Registry (VCR). A VCR is more general component that can drive OrgBooks (repositories of information about registered organizations), and other repositories of verifiable information across a variety of use cases, including education, government services, public works projects and many more. The first generation of OrgBook BC was built on top of the software whose source code is in this repository. The current iteration of OrgBook BC is powered by the Aries Verifiable Credential Registry (VCR) (Aries VCR). TheOrgBook was implemented using custom protocols defined locally by the Verifiable Organizations Network (VON) team here in BC, Aries VCR is based on Hyperledger Aries protocols defined by a global community at the Linux Foundation.

## Demonstrators
### Indy Catalyst - AgentBook - Agent to Agent Messaging Technology

* [bcgov/aries-vcr](https://github.com/bcgov/aries-vcr)
  > Hyperledger Indy Catalyst is a set of application level software components designed to accelerate the adoption of trustworthy entity to entity1 communications based on Decentralized Identity / Self-Sovereign Identity technology and architecture. Indy Catalyst is builds upon globally available open standards and open source software. At present, Indy Catalyst builds upon Hyperledger Indy, common enterprise open source software, frameworks and patterns such as PostgreSQL, Python, Angular and RESTful APIs. Efforts will be taken to design the software to facilitate the incorporation of evolving open standards and technology. The impetus for Indy Catalyst came from the Verifiable Organizations Network (VON) project. More information about VON can be found at vonx.io

    > What is an "Agent"?
    > 1. It acts as a fiduciary on behalf of a single identity owner (or, for agents of things like IoT devices, pets, and similar things, a single *controller*)
    > 2. It holds cryptographic keys that uniquely embody its delegated authorization.
    > 3. It interacts using interoperable agent-to-agent protocols.

  > - Then you get a VC that you were an IIW attendee
  > - Then you were added to the IIWBook directory
  > - Then you could create your own private peer-to-peer connection with any other IIWBook member

  > There was continued discussion about a Connectathon last February where 6 different systems were verified as connecting. Evernym was not a system that passed, but this was not held as a lack of ability as much as direction of activities – they had more important features they were working on. 

Link to presentation provided by John Jordon on Tuesday (Part 1) & Wednesday (Redux): [http://IIW.vonx.io](http://IIW.vonx.io)

* [The VON IIW 28 Demonstration: IIWBook](https://vonx.io/how_to/iiwbook)
  > In late March 2019, the VON team created AgentBook to demonstrate the interoperability of independently created agents. These agents were able to successfully establish DID-based communication channels. Now, with IIWBook, we’ve added a (literal) new layer by extending the core of AgentBook with the ability to exchange verifiable credentials. Even more exciting, through collaboration with Streetcred.id and Spark New Zealand, we have a mobile agent (or two!).
