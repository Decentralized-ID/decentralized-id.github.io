>VON's founding members are governments who are, by law, trusted issuers of data about organizations. The Province of British Columbia, Province of Ontario and the Government of Canada have come together to create the initial services needed to establish VON. 
>
>VON's founders have delivered new Indy-based open source components which form VON's backbone. TheOrgBook is a publicly accessible repository of verifiable claims about organizations. VON-X enables services to verify and issue credentials. - [A Production Government Deployment of Hyperledger Indy- John Jordan, Stephen Curran.](https://hgf18.sched.com/event/G8rm/verifiable-organizations-network-a-production-government-deployment-of-hyperledger-indy-john-jordan-province-of-british-columbia-stephen-curran-cloudcompass-computing-inc)

[Global Connections Made With AgentBook](https://vonx.io/news/2019-03-28-Global-Connection)
  > Using AgentBook, approximately 30 people from South Africa, Europe, Canada and the USA were able to build and run their own Hyperledger Indy agent, connect with other agents using decentralized identifiers (DIDs) to establish a secure communication mechanism, and using that communication mechanism, send messages to each other. 

[The VON IIW 28 Demonstration: IIWBook](https://vonx.io/how_to/iiwbook) - Now, with IIWBook, we’ve added a (literal) new layer by extending the core of AgentBook with the ability to exchange verifiable credentials. Even more exciting, through collaboration with Streetcred and Spark New Zealand, we have a mobile agent (or two!).
  * [iiwbook.vonx.io](https://iiwbook.vonx.io)
    > IIWBook is an authorization service that issues to requesting IIW attendees a Hyperledger Indy-style verifiable credential attesting to their attendance at IIW 28. This is part of a demonstration of self-sovereign identity in action presented by the Government of British Columbia and IIW.
