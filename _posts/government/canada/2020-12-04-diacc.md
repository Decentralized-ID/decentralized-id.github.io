## Organization
* [Digital id authentication council Canada launched](https://diacc.ca/2014/05/12/digital-id-authentication-council-canada-launched/) 05/2014
  > Created as a result of the federal government’s Task Force for the Payments System Review, the DIACC is a non-profit coalition of public and private sector leaders committed to developing a Canadian digital identification and authentication framework to enable Canada’s full and secure participation the global digital economy. DIACC members include representatives from both the federal and provincial levels of government as well as private sector leaders.

  > Toronto, May 6, 2015 – Imagine a world where Canadians can go online to access their medical records, open a bank account, sign a waiver for their children’s hockey camp, or even use their phone to vote. The introduction of a robust, secure, scalable and privacy-enhancing digital identification ecosystem will decrease costs for governments, consumers, and business while improving service delivery and driving GDP growth.
  * [Digital id transformation pillars](https://diacc.ca/2016/05/26/digital-id-transformation-pillars/) 05/2016
  > **Ecosystem Principles**
  > The DIACC believes it is critical to protect and promote Canadian values and perspectives in the digital economy. The DIACC uses the following principles as guidance to support our mission and vision.
  > 
  > Principles of a digital identity ecosystem for Canada, and solutions within:
  > 
  > 🔑 Robust, secure, and scalable\
  > 🔓 Implement, protect, and enhance Privacy by Design\
  > 👥 Inclusive, open, and meets broad stakeholder needs\
  > 📂 Transparent in governance and operation\
  > 🎛️ Provide Canadians choice, control, and convenience\
  > 🖥️ Built on open, standards-based protocols\
  > 🌐 Interoperable with international standards\
  > 👐 Cost effective and open to competitive market forces\
  > 📂 Able to be independently assessed, audited and subject to enforcement\
  > 🗄️ Minimize data transfer between authoritative sources and will not create new identity databases
* [DIACC Roadmap - 2025](https://digital.canada.ca/roadmap-2025/)
  > “Digitize all public-facing government services so they are accessible by web and mobile phone and available behind a unified login system by 2025.”
* [Canada’s Community of Digital Identity Leaders Grows to Over 100 Members](https://diacc.ca/2021/05/31/canadas-community-of-digital-identity-leaders-grows-to-over-100-members/)
  > Today, more than ever before, our communities, our businesses, and our citizens are looking to the leaders within the DIACC to help deliver a robust, secure, trusted digital ID ecosystem that works for all Canadians. Our economy depends on it,” stated David Nikolejsin, Chair of the DIACC Board.
* [The DIACC five year strategic plan](https://diacc.ca/wp-content/plugins/algori-pdf-viewer/dist/web/viewer.html?file=https%3A%2F%2Fdiacc.ca%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F10%2FDIACC-Five-Year-Strategic-Plan.pdf) 10/2020
  > Regardless of how the landscape evolves, the DIACC must have clear goals and actions to support positive strategic outcomes in line with DIACC members’ values, across the range of scenarios.\
  > [...]\
  > **Potential future scenarios:**
  > * **_Platform Identity_**\
  > A walled garden environment where identity is used to keep the user on the platform (or group of affiliated platforms). The platform identity is made available for use in   other contexts but the aim is always to make the platform the center of the user's digital life. Data about the user will be obtained from many sources and aggregated within the platform for its benefit. The commercial model is driven by the commercial model of the platform
  > * **_Operator Networks_**\
  > Groups of operators, typically from regulated industries such as financial services  or telecoms, form consortia to enable the sharing of identity and attribute data. Schemes are established around each consortium which govern all aspects of the identity and attribute sharing network. This includes requirements for participation, fees, and  liability. Identity and attribute data are obtained from known, vetted sources. The network still places a strong emphasis on privacy, allowing the user to have transparency and control of what data is shared and with whom.
  > * **_Self-Sovereign Identity_**\
  > Identity and attribute data is funneled through a wallet or agent employed by the user. Open and standardized frameworks allow the user to obtain verifiable and potentially trusted data from the parties it interacts with and share that data with other parties. Some parties are happy to provide verifiable data to the user without being paid. For other parties, commercial frameworks that add value to the data (e.g. by providing liability) will be developed potentially outside of the technical infrastructure used to share data
  > * **_Open API_**\
  > Data about the user is made available to the user through standardized open APIs. These APIs are provided by organizations in many sectors including financial services, energy, education, and health. They provide access to all types of data including transactional data as well as identity attributes that the user may wish to assert. The APIs enable the user to establish many independent bilateral links between the services it uses. Some APIs will be regulated and non-commercial, others will be commercial. Aggregators seek to simplify the ecosystem by integrating with multiple service providers.
* [Be a Digital ID Champion](https://diacc.ca/champion/)
  > - Promote digital ID to accelerate economic recovery and secure equitable social inclusion.
  > - Work with DIACC and others to establish privacy-protecting digital ID that empowers individuals, businesses, the public sector and civil society.

    > As we start a new decade in 2020, the dominant method for authentication is still a password - the weakest link in the entire security model. The legacy of passwords is that they are targeted by hackers as the simplest way to break into a company to disrupt – or even worse, hold ransom - the targeted victim. Whether exposed from inside or outside the organization, passwords are the Achilles-heel in the security wall. **Why?** *Because passwords can be... Forgotten Written down Lost Shared Sold Stolen* And they are invisible, and that allows a hacker or fraudster to take over an identity.
    > 
    > The biometric world offers a spectrum of options including iris, DNA, heartbeat, voice, gait, palm, and of course, fingerprint. However, these biometric options are not typically embedded in public identity documents, unless you happen to be a convicted felon and have been fingerprinted by the police.

## Recommendations
* [Request for Comment & IPR Review: PCTF Digital Wallet Draft Recommendation V1.0](https://diacc.ca/2022/04/10/digital-wallet-draft-recommendation-v1-0/)
