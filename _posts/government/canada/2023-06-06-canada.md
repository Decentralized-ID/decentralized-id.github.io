  > In a search that started in October 2021, the province was considering vendors to potentially initiate digital ID, meant to replace the need for physical ID cards. According to RFP documents, the selected vendor would have worked with SGI for facial verification, but final details on accessing the photo database weren’t finalized.

* [Ontario’s Digital ID: Technology and standards](https://www.ontario.ca/page/ontarios-digital-id-technology-and-standards) 2022-09-22 Ontario.CA
  > Ontario’s Digital ID will use self-sovereign identity because it gives the holder control over the credentials in their wallet. In addition, we are layering on these extra privacy-preserving features:
  > 
  > - Consent – The verifier must ask you to approve their request to confirm your credentials.
  > - Data minimization – The verifier can only access what they need to confirm you are eligible for their service. For example, if you need to prove that you are old enough to buy a lottery ticket, the store clerk would only know that you are 18 or older – not your actual age, birth date or anything else about you.
  > - Anonymity – Your credentials are not tracked or traced.

All to say, it’s discouraging to see such low participation. [...] I’m not an expert on the election process, and this is just my opinion. I’ve been lazy in past elections, and I’d be lying if I said I’ve voted in every one. As a citizen, I believe ease and accessibility have a lot to do with it.
