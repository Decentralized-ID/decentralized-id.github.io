  > The government is committed to realising the benefits of digital identity, without creating ID cards. Earlier this year we published a draft of the [UK digital identity and attributes trust framework](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-uk-digital-identity-and-attributes-trust-framework). This document sets out what rules and standards are needed to protect people’s sensitive identity data when used digitally. We will put in place the necessary framework and tools so that digital identity products enhance privacy, transparency, confidence and inclusion, and that users are able to control their data, in line with the principles published in the [2019 Call for Evidence response](https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/digital-identity/outcome/digital-identity-call-for-evidence-response). We are also developing and piloting a new ‘One Login for Government’ system that will make it easier for everyone to access government services, with users only having to provide data to prove their identity once, and protecting privacy throughout.

  > Identity service providers can be authorised by a user to share the verified digital identity with relying parties. The relying party can then use this to give them access to the service or create an account. Other identity service providers might choose to create an account associated with a user’s identity. The user can then use and reuse this account to do different things with different relying parties. For example:
  > - identity verification services (which offers a point in time verification, and the user may or may not have an account)
  > - reusable digital identity services with an account and authentication (federated, self sovereign identity (SSI), wallet), and
  > - reusable authentication services with an account and authentication (federated, SSI, wallet).

  > The UK faces a number of digital ID challenges beyond consumer adoption that could slow projects down, particularly when it comes to government-backed programmes. IT and business consulting firm Netcompany was one of a number of firms involved in the NHS Covid Pass scheme, which highlighted the complexity that sits behind any government system in the UK.
  > 
  > “The UK struggles more than some other European countries because we don’t have a unique digital identifier, and that does make it very difficult when you’re trying to deliver something new,” says Richard Davies, UK managing partner at Netcompany, which is also working on the EU digital ID scheme. "You’re effectively having to stitch together or at least navigate what’s under the covers."

It will be essential for that work to not only be underpinned by the twelve guiding principles but also to swiftly ‘sandbox’, stand up parallel proofs in specific sectors and proceed with pace.

  > We believe it is vital that certification bodies work with DCMS and UKAS in a spirit of partnership – bringing together the cumulative value of dozens of great minds! To this end, we have  been encouraged by the proactive approach of DCMS in creating forums where the 5 certification bodies can discuss ideas and feedback on the program in action.
