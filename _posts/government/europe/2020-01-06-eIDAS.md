## Main
* [EIDAS](https://www.eid.as/) - Regulation with linked TOC
* [Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European Parliament](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2014.257.01.0073.01.ENG) and of the Council of 23 July 2014 on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market and repealing Directive 1999/93/EC
  > (2) This Regulation seeks to enhance trust in electronic transactions in the internal market by providing a common foundation for secure electronic interaction between citizens, businesses and public authorities, thereby increasing the effectiveness of public and private online services, electronic business and electronic commerce in the Union.
  > 
  > (3) Directive 1999/93/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (3), dealt with electronic signatures without delivering a comprehensive cross-border and cross-sector framework for secure, trustworthy and easy-to-use electronic transactions. This Regulation enhances and expands the acquis of that Directive.
  > 
  > (11) This Regulation should be applied in full compliance with the principles relating to the protection of personal data provided for in Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (7). In this respect, having regard to the principle of mutual recognition established by this Regulation, authentication for an online service should concern processing of only those identification data that are adequate, relevant and not excessive to grant access to that service online. Furthermore, requirements under Directive 95/46/EC concerning confidentiality and security of processing should be respected by trust service providers and supervisory bodies.
  > 
  > (12) One of the objectives of this Regulation is to remove existing barriers to the cross-border use of electronic identification means used in the Member States to authenticate, for at least public services. This Regulation does not aim to intervene with regard to electronic identity management systems and related infrastructures established in Member States. The aim of this Regulation is to ensure that for access to cross-border online services offered by Member States, secure electronic identification and authentication is possible.
  > 
  > (14) Some conditions need to be set out in this Regulation with regard to which electronic identification means have to be recognised and how the electronic identification schemes should be notified. Those conditions should help Member States to build the necessary trust in each other’s electronic identification schemes and to mutually recognise electronic identification means falling under their notified schemes. The principle of mutual recognition should apply if the notifying Member State’s electronic identification scheme meets the conditions of notification and the notification was published in the Official Journal of the European Union. However, the principle of mutual recognition should only relate to authentication for an online service. The access to those online services and their final delivery to the applicant should be closely linked to the right to receive such services under the conditions set out in national legislation.
* [Trust Services and Electronic identification (eID)](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/trust-services-and-eid)
  > - ensures that people and businesses can use their own national electronic identification schemes (eIDs) to access public services in other EU eID are available.
  > - creates an European internal market for eTS - namely electronic signatures, electronic seals, time stamp, electronic delivery service and website authentication - by ensuring that they will work across borders and have the same legal status as traditional paper based processes. Only by providing certainty on the legal validity of all these services, businesses and citizens will use the digital interactions as their natural way of interaction.

  > The uptake of eIDAS (facilitating cross-border acceptance of eIDs) is low relative to the technical capacity of states; [only 15 of the 27 Member States](https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/35274ac3-cd1b-11ea-adf7-01aa75ed71a1) able to fulfil the regulation’s requirements of accepting the eIDs of other Member States for public services.
  > 
  > The EU Commission did reflect on the effectiveness of the regulation in its [Impact Assessment](https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/35274ac3-cd1b-11ea-adf7-01aa75ed71a1), and is developing a revision of it. There are multiple revision options being discussed, but thus far, the preferred option would establish a framework that provides citizens with optional use of a personal digital wallet

  > Europe is on a "Path to a Digital Decade", which envisions 80% of EU citizens using a digital ID card by 2030. A part of that journey will be self-sovereign identities. Research Analyst Alejandro Leal joins Matthias to continue their discussion on the digital transformation in public services. Self-sovereign identities, the new eIDAS regulation, and the impact of both on how interactions between citizens and the state will change, are a controversial topic in the public discussion as well.
* [eIDAS and Self-Sovereign Identity](https://www.thedinglegroup.com/blog/2021/3/11/eidas-and-self-sovereign-identity) 2021-03-11 ([Video](https://vimeo.com/522501200) Dingle Group
  > Why then is eIDAS v1 not seen as a success? There are many reasons; from parts of the regulation that focused or constrained its use into the public sphere only, to the lack of total coverage across all of the EU. Likely the key missing piece was that the cultural climate was not yet ripe and the state of digital identity was really not ready. Too many technical problems were yet to be solved. Without these elements the realized state of eIDAS should not be unexpected. All this said, eIDAS v1 laid very important groundwork and created an environment to gather important learnings to allow eIDAS v2 to realize the hoped for levels of success and adoption.

## eIDAS Bridge

* [About SSI eIDAS Bridge](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/ssi-eidas-bridge/about) 2022-02-22
  > By sharing Verifiable Credentials, users can prove claims about themselves, but how can the credentials verifier trust them, if the only thing it knows about the issuer is its DID? This is indeed the goal of this project and where the eIDAS regulation can help. eIDAS stands for electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market. It ensures legal validity of electronic documents and cross border trust services, such as electronic signatures and seals. To make eIDAS available as a trust framework in the SSI ecosystem, the European Commission developed under this project, the eIDAS bridge.
* [Time for the eIDAS bridge​](http://validatedid.com/post-en/the-time-for-the-eidas-bridge) 2022-02-18 ValidatedID
  > The main goal of this new program was to provide an implementation of eIDAS bridge and to proof the interoperability between different provider implementations. Validated ID was selected to participate in part of the Call 1 of infrastructure. The results of this project are available as open source. If you are interested in digging into the code, you can find it all in the following repositories: [our open source version implementation](https://gitlab.grnet.gr/essif-lab/infrastructure/validated-id/seb) and the [SSI eIDAS Bridge interoperability](https://gitlab.grnet.gr/essif-lab/interoperability/ssi-eidas-bridge) performed with SICPA.

  > It’s currently possible to be eIDAS compliant with SSI, leveraging one out of five scenarios described in the SSI eIDAS legal report by Dr. Ignacio Alamillo Domingo. Especially interesting is the SSI eIDAS bridge, which adds legal value to verified credentials with the use of electronic certificates and electronic seals. However, it’s also possible to derive national eIDs notified in eIDAS, which are eIDAS linked by issuing a verifiable credential with a qualified certificate according to the technical specification.

  > The European Commission developed the [SSI (Self-Sovereign Identity) eIDAS bridge](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/ssi-eidas-bridge), an ISA2 funded initiative, to promote eIDAS as a trust framework for the SSI ecosystem. It assists a VC (Verifiable Credential) issuer in the signing process, and helps the verifier to automate the identification of the organization behind the issuer’s DID (Decentralized Identifier)


## eIDAS 2.0

  > Until now, the [eIDAS regulation](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/eur/2014/910/contents) has only focused on online identification. However, the new proposal – eIDAS 2.0 – aims to extend identity to the world of physical services which can be accessed from anywhere around the globe.
* [EIDAS 2.0 Turns To Self-Sovereign Identification To Bring Users Ownership And Control](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alastairjohnson/2022/07/05/eidas-20-turns-to-self-sovereign-identification-to-bring-users-ownership-and-control/?sh=853aa7f7f07e) 2022-07-05 Forbes
  > The new proposal will pivot on some of the more key issues that held back the original framework. For example, instead of enforcing a single, rigid ID that openly reveals everything about an individual indefinitely, the eIDAS 2.0 structure can now potentially employ a flexible, self-sovereign identity (SSI) that puts control of all identifying information entirely into the hands of the end-users they pertain to, in both public and private partnership frameworks.

  > The concept of digital identification is already well established, and using a smartphone to board a plane or prove vaccination status is second nature to many millions of people. In the EU however, while many states have made electronic identification available and domestic use is growing, the development of internationally accepted electronic identity (eID) systems has been piecemeal and inconsistent.

  > **Section 19: Decentralised identity and the European regulatory landscape**
  > * EIDAS: A PAN-EUROPEAN NATIONAL IDENTITY STANDARD
  > 
  > Perhaps the most important regulation dealing with identity in the EU is eIDAS, an EU regulation and a set of standards for electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the European Single Market. This regulation will have a deep impact on the decentralised identity framework, above all as it pertains to government-issued/recognised identity credentials, and so is worth a closer look.

  > Although electronic identification under eIDAS Regulation is today clearly aligned with SAML-based infraestructures (see Opinion No. 2/2016 of the Cooperation Network on version 1.1 of the eIDAS Technical specifications, available at https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=37750723 and eIDAS eID Profile, available https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/CEFDIGITAL/eIDAS+Profile), nothing in the eIDAS or its implementing acts should prevent the usage of a SSI system as an electronic identification means.
  > 
  > Thus, the second use case considers a DID as an eIDAS compliant electronic identification means, enabling - at least - transactions with Public Sector authorities and Public Administrations and, if so decided by the DID creator, also with private sector entities.

  > **eIDAS: Key Principles for Identity**
  > - Cooperation between Member States
  > - Reciprocity relying on defined levels of assurance
  > - Mandatory cross-border mutual recognition of identifiers
  > - Sovereignty of Member states to use or introduce means for eID at their national level
  > - Full autonomy to the private sector
  > - Interoperability framework
  > - Member States can use different means of identification, but with the same functionality
  > - The problem is not the technology, but the legal framework, the distribution of liability, and the question to know whether what is enforceable in country A is also enforceable in country B (for instance in the court).

* [eIDAS as guideline for the development of a pan European eID framework in FutureID](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/34614563.pdf) 2014
  > Abstract: This paper addresses the Regulation on Electronic transactions in the internal market: electronic identification and trust services (eIDAS) and analyses this regulatory framework in relation to the pan European eID infrastructure being developed in the FutureID project. The aim of this paper is to identify if eIDAS sets forward any legal requirements that need to be implemented in the FutureID infrastructure. Even though the focus of this paper is on the development of the FutureID infrastructure, the description of eIDAS and the analysis of its main requirements for technical developers are in general relevant to the development of online identification and authentication schemes.
