* [eSSIF-Lab Principles](https://essif-lab.github.io/framework/docs/essifLab-principles) 2022-10-06
  > [Trust](https://essif-lab.github.io/framework/docs/terms/trust) is not something that is given, but something that [parties](https://essif-lab.github.io/framework/docs/terms/party) (un)consciously assess, and decide about, and changes over time. Since parties are autonomous, their trust is highly subjective. As a consequence, the idea of having 'trusted registries', 'trusted issuers' that do not take this subjectivity into account basically act as [(centralized) authorities](https://essif-lab.github.io/framework/docs/terms/authority), denying that parties are autonomous. While we acknowledge that such ideas (have a right to) exist, we do not follow them.
* [eSSIF-Lab Project](https://essif-lab.github.io/framework/docs/essifLab-project) 2022-09-16 eSSIF Lab
  > The objectives of the eSSIF-Lab project itself include:
  > - empower European and other citizens by providing them with new means that help them to electronically negotiate and conduct transactions. These new means will make electronic transactions fast and safe both in the Internet and in physical life, and eliminate logins.
  > - empower European and other organizations and governments by providing new means to speed up, secure and automate transactions with citizens, customers, suppliers and partners, resulting in tens of billions of euros savings annually on administrative costs in Europe.
  > - **ensure these new means support organizations and citizens to exercise their rights and fulfil their duties under the GDPR.**
  > - stimulate these new means foster inclusiveness.
  > - stimulate the pervasive use of new business ecosystem paradigms with thousands of new jobs, many new job categories and new business opportunities for existing and new European companies.
* [eSSIF-Lab Vision and Purpose](https://essif-lab.github.io/framework/docs/vision-and-purpose) 2022-03-29
  > The context of the eSSIF-Lab vision can be found in articles 8-10 of the [European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR)](https://www.echr.coe.int/Pages/home.aspx?p=basictexts/convention), that state the rights of individuals regarding their privacy, and their freedoms to collect, process, store, and express information in a self-sovereign fashion, i.e. in a way that they can decide for themselves.

  > [ComKYC] is a protocol on the Commercio Network blockchain that allows you to issue a KYC verifiable credential after performing a simple set of payments through a bank or any regulated money institution. We piggy back on banks kyc requirements [...] it's a verifiable credential that you can share with anyone who trusts the bank to which this VC is anchored. We have created the first portable derivative key kyc credential protocol that will eliminate the endless passport upload for users, reduce customer dropouts for companies, and reduce time and cost for onboarding new customers

* [SSI Mandate Service by Visma Connect B.V.](https://essif-lab.eu/ssi-mandate-service-by-visma-connect-b-v/) 2022-01-10 ESSIF LAB
  > The SSI mandate service is a generic and holistic approach to provide and request mandates. Mandates are SSI credentials signed by the dependent that can be requested by either the dependent or authorized representative. These credentials can be used to prove to a verifier that the authorized representative is authorized to act for specific actions on behalf of the dependent.
* [OnboardSSI by Quadible](https://essif-lab.eu/onboardssi-by-quadible/) 2022-01-10 ESSIF-LAB
  > The concept of SSI was designed with the citizen and privacy in mind. However, existing implementations lack user-friendliness (e.g. showing hash codes to users), creating potential barriers in users’ adoption. OnboardSSI focuses on providing a secure and user-friendly wallet solution creating an easier way for citizens to manage their identity.

  > **_The project will award 62 subgrants_** in two types of open call: one infrastructure-oriented open call targeting technical enhancements and extensions of the SSI framework and two business-oriented open calls targeting SSI business and social innovations and applications. The infrastructure-oriented open call (open to any type of innovator) and the first business-oriented open call (limited to start-ups and SMEs) are expected to open in March 2020. The exact opening date as well as the terms of reference will be available around February 2020 at essif-lab.eu.

  > eSSIF-Lab is a project funded by the European Commission and aims to advance the broad uptake of SSI as a next generation, open and trusted digital identity solution for faster and safer electronic transactions via the Internet, as well as in real life.
  > 
  > In this project, 5,6M€ EU funds will be made available to European innovators including academic research groups, SME’s and start-ups that want to build or improve SSI (Self-Sovereign Identity) components. The aim of the eSSIF-Lab is to create a range of interoperable, open-source SSI components that will be used within Europe and possibly world-wide

  > On 1 November 2019 the EU Cascaded Funding project ‘eSSIF-Lab’ (European Self-Sovereign Identity Framework Lab) has started. In this project, EU funds will be made available to SMEs and start-ups that want to build or improve SSI components. The aim is to create a range of interoperable, open-source SSI components that people will actually use, not just in the Netherlands, but specifically also within Europe and perhaps world-wide. The first possibilities for SME’s and startups to contribute are expected in March 2020. To get more information about possibilities contact Oskar van Deventer.
