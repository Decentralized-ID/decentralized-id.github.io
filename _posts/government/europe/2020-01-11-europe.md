title: European Digital Identity and SSI
layout: single
description: A digital identity available to all Europeans, enabling access to digital services across the EU and control over which information is shared with third parties
excerpt: By using the European Digital Identity, the user only has to select the necessary documents that are stored locally on his digital wallet to reply to the bank’s request. Then, verifiable digital documents are created and sent securely for verification to the bank, who can then continue with the application process.

* [@EIC2022 Centralized & Decentralized Identity converging](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/eic2022-centralized-decentralized-identity-converging-kuppinger/) 2022-05-18 Martin Kuppinger
  > For me, the most relevant new topic and trend was to finally see the convergence of decentralized identities (DID) and traditional approaches on IAM starting. DID, also referred to as SSI (Self Sovereign Identity) or verifiable credentials, is a concept where the user has a wallet that holds proofs of identities and attributes.

## EU

* [The European Digital Identity Regulation](https://www.european-digital-identity-regulation.com/) 2023-04-08
  > The Regulation amends Regulation (EU) 910/2014 on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market (‘the eIDAS Regulation’). This amendment is required, as digitalisation of all functions of society has increased dramatically. The provision of both public and private services is increasingly becoming digital after the COVID-19 pandemic.

  > The European Union’s cybersecurity agency has been busy typing up its research. The latest report is an overview of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) technologies, standards, providers and regulation from around the world with a view to their relevance applicability to the EU project for digital identity for individuals and businesses.

This study takes a wide view of decentralised electronic identity, considers possible architectural elements and mechanisms of governance, and identifies security risks and opportunities presented by SSI in view of cross-border interoperability, mutual recognition, and technology neutrality as required by eIDAS.

  > With this in mind, the following report provides an overview of the national approaches to electronic identification, describing how the 27 Member States are rolling out eID solutions to ensure that digital services can be securely accessed both at national and at European level. The report focusses on the approaches towards eID outlined in national strategy documents, together with other supporting documentation and web resources, with the aim of offering a thorough understanding of the eID state of play across Europe. This understanding of national strategies can feed into discussions on future EU-level action on eID.

  > [...]
  > The legal instrument aims to provide, for cross-border use:
  > – access to highly secure and trustworthy electronic identity solutions,
  > – that public and private services can rely on trusted and secure digital identity solutions,
  > – that natural and legal persons are empowered to use digital identity solutions,
  > – that these solutions are linked to a variety of attributes and allow for the targeted sharing of identity data limited to the needs of the specific service requested,
  > – acceptance of qualified trust services in the EU and equal conditions for their provision.

These smaller services might be run by startups, nonprofits, co-ops, or even individual tinkerers.

  > This solution for making identities Self-Sovereign, builds on a generic provable claim model for which attestations of truth from third parties need to be collected. The claim model is then shown to be both blockchain structure and proof method agnostic. Four different implementations in support of these two claim model properties are shown to offer sub-second performance for claim creation and claim verification. Through the properties of Self-Sovereign Identity, legally valid status and acceptable performance, our solution is considered to be fit for adoption by the general public

  > In addition to your passport and driving licence, a phone application that enables you to prove your identity quickly and securely and also offers even more privacy options could soon be possible. As part of the Dutch Blockchain Coalition, Delft University of Technology (TU Delft, The Netherlands) has joined forces with the Netherlands Identity Data Agency (RvIG), a division of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Kingdom Relations (BZK), IDEMIA (the current manufacturer of Dutch passports) and law firm CMS, in developing an initial prototype for a digital stamp that could fulfil this purpose in the future. This digital identity is based on TU Delft’s innovative blockchain technology, known as Trustchain. The prototype was demonstrated at a BZK event held on 7 June. After the summer, a consumer trial of this technology will be launched in two Dutch municipalities.

The goal is to specify, validate and ultimately build a trustworthy, open digital infrastructure for self-sovereign identities that is secure, decentralized, open source, supports privacy (e.g., GDPR compliance) in multiple roles, and lacks a single point of failure or large information honey-pot. We aim to follow well-established requirements for user-centric identity systems

Right now, many enterprises and organisations are building their own SSI solutions by implementing the existing standards and protocols. Since all these parties do similar work and have to face similar problems, it is critical for the community to share these learnings and experiences openly. To facilitate this process, the European Blockchain Association e. V. has founded an SSI Working Group which is open to participation from organisations, enterprises and individuals.

  > The panel discussed the creation of self-sovereign identification from three viewpoints – the government, the private sector, and the citizens.
  > 1. The government could lead the way, with a centralized public key infrastructure. The EU EIDAS regulation, adopted in 2014, established electronic identification based on such an infrastructure. Uptake has been a challenge with this approach, however. Some countries have seen high adoption rates, such as Estonia, but other countries, such as Germany, still see a low adoption rate.
  > 2. In a second scenario, the private sector could potentially lead the effort — there are already companies that provide us with secure ID. Some people, however, would be concerned about data privacy.
  > 3. A third path could involve handing back some control to citizens. One example of such an approach is the European Self Sovereign Identity Framework developed by the EU Commission. Here the control lies neither with a centralized government service nor with private companies, but is given to the citizens.

  > The theme of this paper is the use of blockchain and distributed ledger technology for government services, and digital identity in relation to those. The scope for the state-of-the-art is global, but conclusions and recommendations focus on the significance and barriers in the European context. We assume general familiarity with blockchain and smart contract technology. For the purposes of this document, the essential features are that a blockchain has no central data controller or storage, and that it is an append-only immutable record store with reliable timestamping. More specific details, such as consensus mechanism, which vary from one blockchain network to another, are omitted.
