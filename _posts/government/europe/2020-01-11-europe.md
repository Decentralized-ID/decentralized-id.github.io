title: European Digital Identity and SSI
layout: single
description: A digital identity available to all Europeans, enabling access to digital services across the EU and control over which information is shared with third parties
excerpt: By using the European Digital Identity, the user only has to select the necessary documents that are stored locally on his digital wallet to reply to the bank’s request. Then, verifiable digital documents are created and sent securely for verification to the bank, who can then continue with the application process.

  > For me, the most relevant new topic and trend was to finally see the convergence of decentralized identities (DID) and traditional approaches on IAM starting. DID, also referred to as SSI (Self Sovereign Identity) or verifiable credentials, is a concept where the user has a wallet that holds proofs of identities and attributes.

  > In circles of identity management scholars and practitioners, the general consensus is that the region of northern Europe provides a good practice example [...] Out of the eighteen countries included in northern Europe in this paper, one has no national ID; another denies it has, and seven countries only have a voluntary ID. The extent of national ID coverage is hardly known. Also in the European Union, only six in ten countries have a mandatory ID. It does not matter.

  > The EU’s Digital Markets Act (DMA) is set to become law; it will require the biggest tech companies in the world (Apple, Google and Facebook, and maybe a few others) to open up their instant messaging services (iMessage, Facebook Messenger, Whatsapp, and maybe a few others) so that smaller messaging services can plug into them. These smaller services might be run by startups, nonprofits, co-ops, or even individual tinkerers.
* [The European Digital Identity Regulation](https://www.european-digital-identity-regulation.com/) 2023-04-08
  > The Regulation amends Regulation (EU) 910/2014 on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market (‘the eIDAS Regulation’). This amendment is required, as digitalisation of all functions of society has increased dramatically. The provision of both public and private services is increasingly becoming digital after the COVID-19 pandemic.

  > With this in mind, the following report provides an overview of the national approaches to electronic identification, describing how the 27 Member States are rolling out eID solutions to ensure that digital services can be securely accessed both at national and at European level. The report focusses on the approaches towards eID outlined in national strategy documents, together with other supporting documentation and web resources, with the aim of offering a thorough understanding of the eID state of play across Europe. This understanding of national strategies can feed into discussions on future EU-level action on eID.

  > This thesis introduces the concept of self-sovereign identity and analysis the factors required to achieve adoption of the concept. It describes the basic components of a self-sovereign identity system and provides the reader with an overview of important conceptual theories to understand the differences to traditional identity systems and the unique approach taken instead. It then dives into the status quo of the discussions around business, technology, legal and governance aspects. It further examines the central factors for the user and describes a know your costumer use-case as well as the current efforts and challenges for higher education certificates for learners. Furthermore, it depicts the diffusion factors of the innovation. While the legal aspects are mainly concerned with regulations from the European Union, the findings in this thesis can be applied globally.

That starts with creating clarity about the relationship between the Digital Government Act and the EU Digital Identity Wallet.

  > The panel discussed the creation of self-sovereign identification from three viewpoints – the government, the private sector, and the citizens.
  > 1. The government could lead the way, with a centralized public key infrastructure. The EU EIDAS regulation, adopted in 2014, established electronic identification based on such an infrastructure. Uptake has been a challenge with this approach, however. Some countries have seen high adoption rates, such as Estonia, but other countries, such as Germany, still see a low adoption rate.
  > 2. In a second scenario, the private sector could potentially lead the effort — there are already companies that provide us with secure ID. Some people, however, would be concerned about data privacy.
  > 3. A third path could involve handing back some control to citizens. One example of such an approach is the European Self Sovereign Identity Framework developed by the EU Commission. Here the control lies neither with a centralized government service nor with private companies, but is given to the citizens.

  > “There are persistent – and increasingly serious – problems with the way digital identity works,” says the report, ‘Blockchain and Digital Identity’. “For individuals, but also for businesses and governments, the status quo is becoming less and less tenable.”
  > 
  > But the report maps out a path to improving the current digital ID landscape, in which citizens typically use a huge range of systems to access public and private services. “It is now possible to build new identity frameworks based on the concept of decentralised identities,” its authors write, setting out six recommendations for public sector business owners and digital professionals.

  > The theme of this paper is the use of blockchain and distributed ledger technology for government services, and digital identity in relation to those. The scope for the state-of-the-art is global, but conclusions and recommendations focus on the significance and barriers in the European context. We assume general familiarity with blockchain and smart contract technology. For the purposes of this document, the essential features are that a blockchain has no central data controller or storage, and that it is an append-only immutable record store with reliable timestamping. More specific details, such as consensus mechanism, which vary from one blockchain network to another, are omitted.

    * **TrustNet (Finland)**
      > TrustNet is a heavily industry-networked research project that focuses on developing a blockchain-based distributed environment for personal data management following the MyData principles.
    * **Alastria (Spain)**
      > The security and veracity of information will be ensured through the identification of natural and legal persons, while at the same time allowing citizens to have control over their personal information in a transparent way following the guidelines set by the European Union.
    * **Blockchain on the Move (Antwerp, Belgium)**
      > As a cooperation project between the city of Antwerp, the Flemish Information Agency, Digipolis and the Flemish ICT organization (V-ICT-OR), the project Blockchain on the Move is a pilot project on SSI and its application on the municipal level. It explores the potential of SSI for e-Government use cases and State-issued credentials for private sector B2B and B2C use cases.
    * **City of Zug (UPort and ti&m)**
      > With the SSI implemented in Zug, users can now pay their parking fees, register for elections or perform online sign on for e-government services33. The benefits range for the city of Zug are low infrastructure requirements, decreased security risks, cost effectiveness, GDPR compliance and scalability.
    * **Danube Tech (Austria)**
      > In a SSI proof-of-concept during the first half of 2018, 3 banks, an insurance company, the Austrian Post, and an institution representing notaries has cooperated to implement a range of use cases based on DIDs, Verifiable Credentials, Sovrin, and the XDI protocol. The use cases included:
      > * digital ID onboarding for existing clients,
	  > * SSO for new clients,KYC
	  > * sharing of KYC data between organizations,
	  > * dynamic data verification (change-of-address),
	  > * secure communication (e-mail with ID confirmation),
	  > * change of identity service providers,
	  > * personal ID verification in a peer-to-peer marketplace
