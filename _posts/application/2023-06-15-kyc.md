* [Importance of an Integrated KYC solution for your compliance program](https://kyc-chain.com/importance-of-an-integrated-kyc-solution-for-your-compliance-program/) 2022-04-12 KYC-Chain
  > The way many businesses have traditionally implemented KYC is by taking a manual, fragmented approach – essentially implementing various different KYC processes using different tools, methods and resources, including human compliance teams.

  > Since the same data is required and utilised by everyone, blockchain-based SSI can satisfy the demand for general service for data without creating competition while also adhering to legislation and consumer expectations around data protection.

  > self-sovereign identity verification, one of the game-changing [background screening trends of 2021](https://www.corporatescreening.com/2021-trends-interactive-infographic). When combined with screening activities, self-sovereign identity solutions offer opportunities to obtain more accurate candidate background data and deliver it to employers faster.

## Literature
* [Designing a Framework for Digital KYC Processes Built on Blockchain-Based Self-Sovereign Identity](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.01237.pdf) 2021-11-11 Vincent Schlatt, Johannes Sedlmeir, Simon Feulner, Nils Urbach
  > We demonstrate how blockchain-based self-sovereign identity (SSI) can solve the challenges of KYC. We follow a rigorous design science research approach to create a framework that utilizes SSI in the KYC process, deriving nascent design principles that theorize on blockchain’s role for SSI.
* [zkKYC: A solution concept for KYC without knowing your customer, leveraging self-sovereign identity and zero-knowledge proofs](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/907) 2021-07-05 Pieter Pauwels 
  > The proposed solution concept, zkKYC, removes the need for the customer to share any personal information with a regulated business for the purpose of KYC, and yet provides the transparency to allow for a customer to be identified if and when that is ruled necessary by a designated governing entity (e.g. regulator, law enforcement). This approach breaks the traditional privacy vs. transparency trade-off and provides structured transparency, resulting in a net positive outcome for all parties involved.
