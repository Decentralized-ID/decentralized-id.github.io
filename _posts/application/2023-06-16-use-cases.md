  > This paper addresses that need by offering arguments to a variety of people who might be reluctant to use self-sovereign identity, uninterested in its possibilities, or oblivious to the dangers of centralization. By focusing on the needs of real people, we hope to also encourage developers, engineers, and software business owners to create the apps that will address their reluctance and fulfill their needs, making self-sovereign identity a reality.
    
## Use Cases
### Career
* [Coming soon — a resume-validating blockchain network for job seeker](https://www.computerworld.com/article/3675547/coming-soon-a-resume-validating-blockchain-network-for-job-seekers.html#tk.rss_security) 2022-10-05 Computer World

  > This model lets the identity owner easily organize a unique, verifiable learning path from a wide variety of resources to powerfully prepare for a particular job. Similarly, employers can encourage job candidates to complete recommended learning paths for certain roles, ensuring that they enter the organization with the right skills and verifiable competencies. Or, employers can upskill employees by designing curriculums that draw upon a diverse variety of online courses, university or community college programs, coding academies, or other competency evaluation frameworks. Any course that is completed, a certificate that is earned, or work experience that is gained will produce a verifiable credential that can be shared with any other entity that uses a compatible self-sovereign identity system.

  > SSI has the power to change the world for the better by flipping the power dynamic surrounding digital identities and trust from large corporations and governments back to the individual. This technology empowers individuals and communities to take back control of both their personal data as well as of their digital assets and identities, and decide exactly how and when this information is to be used and shared. This session explores how SSI-based ecosystems are built and how this transition benefits both individuals and the wider global community.

  > With increasing digitization, more and more people use their identification credentials for accessing online services; which increases concern for data privacy. To ensure user's privacy, alternate credential management schemes must be adopted. Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) is a form of credential management where users are in charge of their credentials. Privacy-critical data is stored at the user's end and they can choose to do selective disclosure of minimal required information to access services. Currently, SSI solutions are not being widely adopted by service providers and the ecosystem is fragmented. One of the reasons for the lack of adoption is the need for maintaining private infrastructure for credential issuance, as critical user information is to be handled during credential issuance. To cater to this, we present a solution that enables the service providers to run their credential issuers on public cloud - a so-called Credentials as a Service (CaaS). CaaS issuers run inside Trusted Execution Environments (TEE) enabling credential issuers to ensure user's privacy while enjoying the flexibility of the pay-per-use cloud model. CaaS can pave the way for making SSI credentials ubiquitous in identity management solutions.

  > Why? Because the pieces of evidence that administrative agencies require to register property — things like a survey plan, a notarized will, or a state-issued identity card — may be inaccessible, or may not represent the reality of rights on the ground.

  > Our interest in identity systems was an inevitable outgrowth of our earlier work on blockchain-based1 land registries.2 Property registries, which at the simplest level are ledgers of who has which rights to which asset, require a very secure and reliable means of identifying both people and properties. In the course of investigating solutions to that problem, we began to appreciate the broader challenges of digital identity and its role in international development. And the more we learned about digital identity, the more convinced we became of the need for self-sovereign identity, or SSI. This model, and the underlying principles of identity which it incorporates, will be described in detail in this paper.

  > revocation acceptance is at the discretion of individual clients, making our mechanism fully adhere to the principles of Self-Sovereignty. This revocation and verification structure is part of our Industry-Grade Self-Sovereign Identity (IG-SSI) architecture. IG-SSI is a purely academic fully distributed SSI scheme with intrinsic equality across the network. Furthermore, communication is facilitated peer-to-peer, requiring no specialised infrastructure.

  > At the core of our conceptual analysis is the service process, which we extract from a reference model. Based on a SWOT analysis, we identify areas for transformation and derive an SSI-enabled interaction model for an electric vehicle charging service. The evaluation of the new process shows that SSI can reduce complexity of integration with partners and can provide a better customer experience through simplified registration and authentication.

  > * Self-sovereign identity could save time and money on bureaucratic processes (form filling and validation) by automating business decisions. 
  > * Business decisions require governance to ensure the data used for making them qualifies (is valid) for that purpose, and continuously remains compliant with laws, regulations, and company policies (which regularly change). 
  > * Companies could share this governance burden by supporting communities that support the provisioning of SSI-related assurances for their specific purposes. 
  > * Such (focused) assurance communities could be supported by tools like credential catalogs and accreditation credentials. We hope this paper inspires SSI proponents to develop not only real SSI infrastructure, but also assurance mechanisms for exchanging qualified data.
