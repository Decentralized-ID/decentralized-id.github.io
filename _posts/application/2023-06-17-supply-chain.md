title: Supply Chains and Self Sovereign Identity
description: A highly scalable operating model for digitisation and trust of cross border trade based on verifiable credentials.
excerpt: >
  The digital and physical world are merging more than ever before. As the supply chain becomes more ‘phygital,’ innovative ways of sharing data – like using verifiable credentials – are helping to build more trust with data along the supply chain.

  > There is no limit to what a DID can identify. The obvious examples are organizations and people, as explained above. They can also represent assets such as shipping containers, seals, boxes, vessels, or locations, and intangible concepts like bookings, agreements, transactions, or documents.

  > The benefit is a circular supply chain that goes beyond where it started and creates a closer connection between consumers and small growers. Processors, distributors, wholesalers and retailers can trace product provenance, creating market differentiation for sustainability, food security and quality. The hope is that by aligning incentives through an immersive customer experience that fosters informed purchasing decisions, we can empower an inclusive economy that encourages the actions to mitigate environmental impact and benefit people.

  > To address trust and privacy issues in IOBP, this paper presents a Blockchain-based Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) approach. The SSI concept is combined with a registry proof smart contract to provide an efficient privacy-preserving solution. The proposed approach is applied to the pharmaceutical supply chain case study and implemented on the Ethereum Blockchain

  > This paper introduces a software architecture and implementation of a system based on design patterns from the field of self-sovereign identity. Scientists can issue signed credentials attesting to qualities of their data resources. Data contributions to ML models are recorded in a bill of materials (BOM), which is stored with the model as a verifiable credential. The BOM provides a traceable record of the supply chain for an AI system, which facilitates on-going scrutiny of the qualities of the contributing components.
