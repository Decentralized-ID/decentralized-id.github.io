title: The Covid Pandemic and Self Sovereign Identity
description: How a cryptographically secure digital credential can be used instead of paper documents
excerpt: >
  In a lot of places around the world, a COVID passport is simply a paper document. This has led to a couple of expected problems, one to mention is forgery. Paper documents can easily be forfeited, and paper-based COVID passports are no exception.

  > My poster looks at a sweet spot in digital vaccine certificates. Too little identity and proof of vaccination is insecure; too much identity and the proof threatens privacy.
  > 
  > To set the scene, it worries me that COVID vaccination is seen by some as the killer application for exotic technology or digital ideology. We should not impose these sorts of changes onto health systems especially in developing countries. They disrupt established ways of managing patients and they’re not necessary for privacy.

  > Health passes, though, are much more flexible as they provide multiple options. They can still be used as proof of vaccination, if the user chooses to share their health information in this way.
  > 
  > But, importantly and in a crucial difference from vaccine passports, they can also be used to securely display a test result, such as a negative PCR or rapid antigen test (also known as lateral flow tests) today. Additionally, they are also future-proofed for options such as rapid antibody test results when those come into play on a large scale.

In recent weeks, we’ve seen [Heathrow airport reporting delays of up to six hours](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-56743571).

In this panel discussion, SITA and Indicio.tech will share their journey of applying verifiable credentials in commercial aviation and travel/hospitality to make it easy for visitors entering a country to share a trusted traveler credential – based on their health status, yet revealing no personal information or health data – privately and securely on their mobile device.

Now, in a very short period of time, we need to produce a digital credential that can be as universally recognized as a passport and it needs an even greater level of privacy because it’s going to be digital.”

    > In many cases, the problem underpinning IoT network security resembles the classic blockchain business case: to create trust — in this case, trustful data and message exchange — in a trustless environment. While the self-sovereign identity (SSI) concept resolves this problem in a specifically distributed manner, we want to explore current solutions, and compare their properties to distributed architectures, including SSI. Many desirable network properties (throughput, simplicity, confidentiality, to name a few) are much easier implemented in conventional solutions — it will be exciting to understand how each approach can deliver value for IoT network security depending on the specific application.

  > DIWG member countries each have relevant policies and/or legislation which cover their respective approaches towards digital identity, captured through policy, legislative and trust frameworks governing the digital identity systems. For most, trust frameworks and digital identity systems were implemented using existing government policies and legislation as a foundation, for example existing privacy legislation, and broadly align to ISO standards (as defined by the International Organisation for Standardisation), European Union (EU) standards (as defined through the eIDAS regulation) or industry best practice. A similar model was found for technical settings across digital identity systems

  > Linux Foundation Public Health (LFPH) today announces the launch of the Global COVID Certificate Network (GCCN) to facilitate the safe and free movement of individuals globally during the COVID pandemic. GCCN will establish a global trust registry network that enables interoperable and trustworthy exchanges of COVID certificates among countries for safe reopening and provide related technology and guidance for implementation. The effort is initially supported by Affinidi, AOKPass, Blockchain Labs, Evernym, IBM, Indicio.Tech, LACChain, Lumedic, Proof Market and ThoughtWorks, who have implemented COVID certificate or pass systems for governments and industries. LFPH will work with them to define and implement GCCN. 
* [Introducing the Global COVID Certificate Network (GCCN)](https://www.lfph.io/2021/06/08/gccn/) 2021-06-08 LFPH
  > As more and more governments adopt [major COVID certificate standards](https://www.lfph.io/2021/10/12/global-covid-certificate-landscape/) to reopen borders, the travel industry is working hard to catch up on their technology to meet the evolving travel requirements. However, there is still no shortage of complaints from travelers about their cumbersome international travel experiences

  > MedCreds is a reference implementation of the Governance Framework and Use-Cases that have been developed in the CCI community.  
  > 
  > MedCreds is built on top of INDY and ARIES and is running on the SOVRIN Main Net. This is done through Trinsic (a third-party vendor)’s APIs. Trinsic agreed to document how to do this using the API’s on ARIES and devote an engineer to give instructions for how to use the open source code to run MedCreds.
  > 
  > MedCreds can be extended to support new credential schemas.

  > Indicio’s Cardea ecosystem easily integrates with existing applications, allowing people, businesses, healthcare systems, and governments to work together to safely reopen physical locations such as offices, restaurants, venues, schools, and travel, while complying with global health and data privacy laws. The ecosystem frees businesses, organizations, and governments from having to store and manage people’s private medical information. Instead, decentralized identity enables the individual to independently acquire and control their data and securely share or selectively disclose it at their discretion with full consent.

  > The CCI community collaborated with Linux Foundation Public Health to write a letter to the Biden Administration about how Verifiable Credentials could be used to support re-opening the economy.
  > 
  > "Some states and other countries have started to pilot this approach, as have various industries like film and aviation. But, the inconsistent use of standards and varying implementations have already led to confusion and public concern. An effort coordinated at the federal level would lead most quickly to uniform adoption and true inter-state and cross-domain interoperability."

  > Solution assumption with the Good Health Pass is revoking is not necessary as VCs are short lived (solution to invalid credential). Issuers will re-issue vs. revoke
  > 
  > In many cases, labs are providing incorrect information in vaccination records, which need to be re-issued
  > - Still need to notify the holder that their (current VC) is invalid and they need to take action to resolve
  > - Issuers asking what if we make a mistake – (re-issue)
  > - Holders having problems findin there vaccination VC
  > - Many of the unresolved issues are governance/policy related (for which the “health authorities”) have not worked out the details
  > - Policy providers are applying the brakes through in-grained bureaucracy to produce a perfect standard for their jurisdiction vs. rapidly evolving a common standard and “usable solution” in the short term.
  > - Unclear on how to get VC and underlying data into the hands of holders, particularly as holders don’t have the technology and skills to manage their health data.
  > - Data privacy is an issue across each of the implementers and users of the Issuer, Holder and Verifier roles. Lack of common understanding and agreement on how and who owns and controls the data
  > - WHO standard will likely be adopted in the Global South (hemisphere)
  > - GHP looking to paint a forward looking common picture, including interim solutions (iterate standards)
  > - The number of players (and their levels of understanding/expertise and agreement with the current direction) alone makes consensus very difficult
  > - Paper credentials have been getting consensus on interim solutions.
  > - W3C and WHO are great candidates.
  > - Affinidi is making a universal verifier application (https://www.affinidi.com/)

  > Before responding to the questions, we want to point out that the use of the term “COVID-19 passports” is questionable as the word ‘passport’ is used for the identity and travel document issued by nation states to their citizens. Another reason to question the use of ‘passport’ is the fact that our passport data is stored or centralized by the nation state issuer. Centralized systems are notorious and can be a source of potential  data breaches and abuses.
