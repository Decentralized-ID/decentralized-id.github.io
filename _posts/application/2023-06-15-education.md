description: The electronic signature improves the experience in education for students, teachers, parents, guardians and other school staff.
excerpt: >
  Since most of the educational institutes were facing security crises, new challenges are added to the security system to identify and manage the users’ access to these platforms.The most relevant challenges include but not limited to, legacy identity infrastructure, student lifecycle and users access complexity and new cyber threats.

  > like many other aspects of our daily lives, the digital transformation of education and training has added both convenience and challenges. Much like the shift to remote work, we can now learn from the comfort of our homes. Gone are the days of taking an in-person course where you receive your gold-sealed certificate upon completion of the last class, or walk across a stage to pick up your hard-earned degree.

  > Due to the high level of international mobility in the academic sector, insular solutions relying on only one national type of government-issued digital ID card will be insufficient; instead, the officials at the federation need to decide which digital ID cards are valid to uniquely associate an individual with private cryptographic keys, similar to the way passports are acknowledged internationally

  > Super Skills falls into the category of informal learning, but with the use of DIDs, VCs, and digital wallets, we are able to issue provable credentials for children that persist outside of the game. They can be presented and verified without having to communicate with our systems or LEGO, capturing the learning and putting control into the learner’s hands.

  > The ULC will leverage blockchain technology to deploy a library identity and credentialing application to be developed by the Learning Economy. It will connect existing library information and library card systems while allowing libraries to continue managing users with their existing technology infrastructures already in use. The design architecture (as shown in the figures below) will provide for the following:

  > Although the blockchain has long been identified as an opportunity for driving much-needed change in the core processes of the education sector, use cases to date have been limited in scope and execution, with blockchain advocates and education policy makers seemingly disconnected on fundamental issues such as governance, self-sovereignty, interoperability, choice of blockchain platforms and overall trust in standards and the integrity of the infrastructure.

  > This report is the first phase of the Education Blockchain Initiative, funded by the U.S. Department of Education and managed by the American Council on Education (ACE). It summarizes an intensive research project to better understand the application of blockchain, a form of distributed ledger technology, to education. Its content is intended to inform policymakers, technology developers, education practitioners, and workforce entities about the state of and potential of interoperable digital credentials anchored on blockchains. This report also provides guidance to these stakeholders on the effective implementation of blockchain-based digital credentials infrastructure.
