## Explainer
* [Verifiable Credentials set to Revolutionize Health and Safety Compliance](https://blog.dock.io/verifiable-credentials-set-to-revolutionize-health-and-safety-compliance/) 2021-11-05 Dock
  > By integrating with Dock and utilizing verifiable credentials, the process of verifying a workers qualifications goes from analysing paper-based certificates and calling each educational body to certify the legitimacy of it, to having the accreditations sitting in a tamper-proof digital wallet, with a digital signature signature from the issuing body certifying the legitimacy.
* [How decentralised identity & verifiable credentials will transform the world of healthcare](https://www.htworld.co.uk/insight/decentralized-identity-verifiable-credentials-healthcare/) 2021-08-20 HealthTech World
  > When a medical accrediting agency provides a digitally signed certificate, the healthcare practitioner and owner of that certificate holds the credential in a digital wallet. The details of the credential such as the time stamp in which the certificate was given and how long it is valid for, can be optionally held within a blockchain network, digitally linked to the certificate, this process is called ‘anchoring’.

  > this workflow doesn’t involve any third-party to store your medical data and this also means no worry about medical data storage policies and the laws associated with it. The holder completely owns his or her medical data and stores it exclusively in his or her digital wallet, thereby making it secure and hassle-free.

## Project
* [A Digital Staff Passport for hospital facilities, DIZME voted best solution at SHACK22 hackathon](https://infocert.digital/a-digital-staff-passport-for-the-safe-mobility-of-staff-in-hospital-facilities-dizme-has-been-voted-as-the-best-solution-at-shack22-hackathon/) 2022-07-08 Infocert
  > The hackathon held by INTEROPen, a leading organization to support & accelerate the delivery and adoption of Interoperability Standards in health & social, in partnership with NHS (National Health System) was aimed at developing innovative solutions for the management of access and safe mobility of staff in hospital facilities.

  > Healthcare is a key case-use of the SSI model employing blockchain given the significance and scalability of this sectoral. In this article, we give you details about a pilot project developed for the Andalusian Health Service in Spain to evidence the feasibility of a vaccination card according to the Alastria Self-Sovereign Identity system based on Blockchain technology.
* [Patient-Centric Identity Management for Healthcare with Jim St-Clair](https://northernblock.io/patient-centric-identity-management-for-healthcare/) 2021-04-13 Northern Block
  > I began working with Lumedic in January of this year, specifically focused on digital identity standards, especially in self-sovereign identity, and also continuing to work in HL7. Lumedic is part of Providence Health Systems, and we play a very active role in several HL7 initiatives for health IT and data exchange. It’s very complementary to the work we’re doing with groups like Sovrin, the Trust over IP Foundation, and so on.

## Business
* [The Future of Healthcare Relies on Adaptation](https://auth0.com/blog/the-future-of-healthcare-relies-on-adaptation/) 2021-10-14 auth0
  > Most healthcare organizations are and should be, focused on their core business pursuits, such as patient care or processing insurance claims. Information security and identity management is not their core business, yet is a critical factor in compliant, secure business operations.

## Policy
* ["Member as API" - The Interoperability and Patient Access final rule and Verifiable Credentials](https://www.pocketcred.com/post/member-as-api-the-interoperability-and-patient-access-final-rule-and-verifiable-credentials) 2021-07-26 PocketCred
  > The Interoperability and Patient Access final rule (CMS-9115-F) delivers on the government's promise to put patients first, giving them access to their health information when they need it most and in a way they can best use it. As part of the MyHealthEData initiative, this final rule is focused on driving interoperability and patient access to health information by liberating patient data using CMS authority to regulate Medicare Advantage (MA), Medicaid, CHIP, and Qualified Health Plan (QHP) issuers on the Federally-facilitated Exchanges (FFEs).
* [21st Century Cures Act](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/05/01/2020-07419/21st-century-cures-act-interoperability-information-blocking-and-the-onc-health-it-certification) 2020-05-01
  > This final rule implements certain provisions of the 21st Century Cures Act, including Conditions and Maintenance of Certification requirements for health information technology (health IT) developers under the ONC Health IT Certification Program (Program), the voluntary certification of health IT for use by pediatric health care providers, and reasonable and necessary activities that do not constitute information blocking. The implementation of these provisions will advance interoperability and support the access, exchange, and use of electronic health information. The rule also finalizes certain modifications to the 2015 Edition health IT certification criteria and Program in additional ways to advance interoperability, enhance health IT certification, and reduce burden and costs.

## Standards
* [What SMART on FHIR Means for the Future of Healthcare](https://auth0.com/blog/what-smart-on-fhir-means-for-the-future-of-healthcare/) 2021-09-07 Auth0
  > The Substitutable Medical Applications and Reusable Technologies (SMART) platform promises to solve these data fragmentation challenges by standardizing how patient data is accessed and shared. And given SMART’s inclusion in the [21st Century Cures Act](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/05/01/2020-07419/21st-century-cures-act-interoperability-information-blocking-and-the-onc-health-it-certification), the platform will become the standard protocol for accessing electronic health records (EHRs) in the near future.

  > - We have to get to protocol/standards like we did with email
  > - It will be messy and competitive with new players who emerge and offer more freedom
  > - Those who can’t adapt will lose ground - need to be willing to let go
  > - Messaging apps: Signal/What’s APp - PRESSURE...eventually someone will make it so that they work together and scoop up everyone’s business

Mars, war zones, bad neighbors, Great Firewalls.](https://iiw.idcommons.net/11C/_Rugged_Identity:_resilience_for_Identity_of_Things_to_bad_latency,_signal,_power,_physical_integrity.) 2021-05-06 Phil Wolff
  > Problem: So, what happens when you can’t call home to conduct an identity conversation? You’re on Mars and the latency is long. You’re in Haiti and the bandwidth is very limited during a storm. You’re in a war zone and your signal is noisy due to interference.
  > 
  > Rugged Identity is hoped-for resilience from very long latency, noisy signal, low bandwidth, interrupted connections, very low power computing and radio, power outages, and attacks on physical integrity like device tampering.

  > So there’s demand for a new category of IoT and #IoMD that survives and thrives despite these challenges. Very low power consumption. Lots of storage and caching to hold on through power outages. Ruggedized for use outside clinics. Easy and cheap to field-repair. Lots of smarts inside so they work without an internet tap. Many flavors of connectivity to exploit opportunities as they knock. Open sourced, the better to adapt to new and unplanned problems.
