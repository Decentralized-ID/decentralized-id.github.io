## Explainer 

* [ITN, European Commission] [Why is Trusted Identity Important in IoT Commerce?](https://dlt.mobi/why-is-trusted-identity-important-in-iot-commerce/) 2022-07-14 MOBI
  > This technology has enormous implications for consumers and organizations alike. For consumers, it spells a more seamless way of interacting with the devices used in day-to-day life. Likewise, many industries across the globe are increasingly turning to IoT to automate business processes, support the development of interoperable value chains, and enhance asset management.
* [Why Machines Need Self-Sovereign Identities](https://www.peaq.network/blog/why-machines-need-self-sovereign-identities) 2021-10-18 Peaq
  > As the world becomes even more connected and more machines are hooked up to the internet, the ability for machines to move, trade and interact securely and efficiently becomes increasingly important to life and business. Today’s centralized networks do not enable this. Machines today exist on closed, permission-based environments which massively limit which other machines can be interacted with, what machines can do and where they can go.
* [Self-Sovereign Identity and IoT – insights from the Sovrin Foundation](https://insureblocks.com/?p=12699) 2021-09-21 Insureblocks
  > Michael Shea is the Managing Director of the Dingle Group and the Chair of Sovrin Foundation’sSSI in IoT Working Group. In this podcast we discussed the white paper he authored on Self Sovereign Identity and IoT. To explain the opportunities SSI can provide to IoT, Michael introduces us to three profiles: Jamie (machine to person), Bob (machine to machine) and Bessie the cow (digital twin).
* [Toothbrush Identity](https://www.windley.com/archives/2021/09/toothbrush_identity.shtml) 2021-09 Phil Windey
  > Identity finds its way into everything—even toothbrushes. Careful planning can overcome privacy concerns to yield real benefits to businesses and customers alike.
* [Smart Property](https://www.windley.com/archives/2021/08/smart_property.shtml) 2021-08 Phil Windley
  > Smart property is much more than the anemic connected things we have now. Smart property imagines a world where every thing participates in digital communities and ecosystems, working through programmable agents under the owners control.
* [Digital Twins and Self-Sovereign Identity: Build the next generation of Simulation with privacy preservation](https://iotpractitioner.com/digital-twins-and-self-sovereign-identity-build-the-next-generation-of-simulation-with-privacy-preservation/) 2021-07-30 IOT Practicioner
  > Managing IoT devices and user identities as well as the relationships among various devices and their digital twins face significant challenges. First, a lack of Identity Credential and Access Management (ICAM) standards for IoT creates proprietary standards and a lack of interoperability. Second, the operational lifecycle of IoT devices complicates integration of traditional ICAM. Lastly, ICAM technology must adapt to the proliferation of connected devices. This evolution requires a digital trust framework and the decentralized architecture of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI).
* [Alternatives to the CompuServe of Things](https://www.windley.com/archives/2021/07/alternatives_to_the_compuserve_of_things.shtml) 2021-07 Phil Windley
  > The current model for connected things puts manufacturers in between people and their things. That model negatively affects personal freedom, privacy, and society. Alternate models can provide the same benefits of connected devices without the societal and personal costs.
* [Decentralized identity can bring the analog world into the digital one](https://cointelegraph.com/news/decentralized-identity-can-bring-the-analog-world-into-the-digital-one) 2021-06-20 Cointelegraph
  > DID does not require analog objects to become digitized, and it does not need expensive sensors or hi-tech tags to work correctly. Instead, it offers an affordable, reliable and versatile way to take offline items out of the digital blindspot.
* [Relationships in the Self-Sovereign Internet of Things](https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/12/relationships_in_the_self-sovereign_internet_of_things.shtml) 2020-12 Phil Windley
  > DIDComm-capable agents provide a flexible infrastructure for numerous internet of things use cases. This post looks at Alice and her digital relationship with her F-150 truck. She and the truck have relationships and interactions with the people and institutions she engages as she co-owns, lends and sells it. These and other complicated workflows are all supported by a standards-based, open-source, protocol-supporting system for secure, privacy-preserving messaging.

## Development
* [Juicy Telemetry](https://wider.team/2022/04/04/juicy-telemetry/) 2022-04-04 Wilder Team
  > I was in a [Sovrin IoT](https://sovrin.org/) call when I heard the phrase “juicy telemetry.” A digital twins product leader was bemoaning all the really good data held back by the manufacturers of equipment. Data they needed to properly model their twins, to keep them current, to validate their assumptions. For good and bad reasons, the makers of wind turbines and cars and ship engines and weather sensors choose to hide data.
* [Easier IoT Deployments with LoraWan and Helium](https://www.windley.com/archives/2022/04/easier_iot_deployments_with_lorawan_and_helium.shtml) 2022-04 Phil Windley
  > Unlike a Wifi network, you don't put the network credentials in the device, you put the devices credentials (keys) in the network. Once I'd done that, the sensor started connecting to hotspots near my house and transmitting data. Today I've been driving around with it in my truck and it's roaming onto other hotspots as needed, still reporting temperatures.

## Paper

* [Presentation] [IoT Swarms + SSI in constrained networks](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/15ix2vzR_Dq9xcs-8OY0qBjapy9dpY-WdRKph9SiEY-0/edit?usp=sharing) 2021-07-21 [source](https://iiw.idcommons.net/12E/_IoT_Swarms_+_SSI_in_constrained_networks) - [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.10232) Geovane Fedrecheski, Laisa C. P. Costa, Samira Afzal, Jan M. Rabaey, Roseli D. Lopes, Marcelo K. Zuffo
  > One of the challenges identified by this last paper is the overhead of using SSI, which poses a challenge for adoption on constrained IoT networks. For example, while the Long Range (LoRa) communication, often used in IoT systems, only allows payloads of up to 240 bytes, a single DID Document typically occupies 500 bytes or more. Similarly, messages using DIDComm tend to use at least 1 kilobyte, which prevents its use on constrained networks.<br>Figure 1. Binary versions of DIDComm and DID Documents are needed to allow transmission in LoRa networks. The payload, in blue, is a DID Document. The overhead, in orange, is the protocol overhead due to the message signature.
  > 
  > A low-overhead approach for self-sovereign identity in IoT	We present a low-overhead mechanism for self-sovereign identification and communication of IoT agents in constrained networks. Our main contribution is to enable native use of Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and DID-based secure communication on constrained networks, whereas previous works either did not consider the issue or relied on proxy-based architectures. We propose a new extension to DIDs along with a more concise serialization method for DID metadata. Moreover, in order to reduce the security overhead over transmitted messages, we adopted a binary message envelope. We implemented these proposals within the context of Swarm Computing, an approach for decentralized IoT. Results showed that our proposal reduces the size of identity metadata in almost four times and security overhead up to five times. We observed that both techniques are required to enable operation on constrained networks.

  > This paper analyses the concept of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI), an emerging approach for establishing digital identity, in the context of the Internet of Things (IoT). We contrast existing approaches for identity on the Internet, such as cloud-based accounts and digital certificates, with SSI standards such as Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first thorough comparison of these approaches. The benefits and challenges of using DIDs and VCs to identify and authenticate IoT devices and their respective users are discussed. In the end, we establish that SSI, with its owner-centric, privacy-aware and decentrailized approach, provides a viable and attractive option for secure identification of IoT devices and users.

  > in our point of view, a lot of development groups are working in parallel on the similar topics, yet it is not clear what is going on inside. In this paper we will try to define the differences and discuss both pros and cons of using such commonly known technologies as Sovrin based upon the Hyperledger Indy technology, Civic, Jolocom, uPort and some others. Besides, we’ll tackle the idea of using the SSI for inanimate object and how it can be constructed in this way.
