description: "Digital identities interoperable across administrative domains, applications, and any other silo."
excerpt: >
  Hyperledger Indy provides tools, libraries, and reusable components for providing digital identities rooted on blockchains or other distributed ledgers so that they are interoperable across administrative domains, applications, and any other silo. Indy is interoperable with other blockchains or can be used standalone powering the decentralization of identity.

### Main
* [Hyperledger Indy - *Distributed Ledger and Utility Library*](https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/hyperledger-indy) - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Hyperledger) - [Chat](https://chat.hyperledger.org) - [Forum](https://forum.sovrin.org) - [Wiki](https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/indy) - [Documentation](https://indy.readthedocs.io/)
  > Hyperledger Indy provides tools, libraries, and reusable components for providing digital identities rooted on blockchains or other distributed ledgers so that they are interoperable across administrative domains, applications, and any other silo.
* [hyperledger/indy-node](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node)
  > This codebase embodies all the functionality to run nodes (validators and/or observers) that provide a self-sovereign identity ecosystem on top of a distributed ledger. It is the core project for Indy; over time, all other indy-* projects may collapse into this one, except for indy-sdk.
* [hyperledger/indy-sdk](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk)
  > This is the official SDK for Hyperledger Indy, which provides a distributed-ledger-based foundation for self-sovereign identity. Indy provides a software ecosystem for private, secure, and powerful identity, and the Indy SDK enables clients for it. The major artifact of the SDK is a C-callable library; there are also convenience wrappers for various programming languages and Indy CLI tool.  

## About 

* [Strengthening Hyperledger Indy and Self-Sovereign Identity](https://www.hyperledger.org/blog/2019/07/18/strengthening-hyperledger-indy-and-self-sovereign-identity) 2019-07-08
  > Forrester’s recent “[Top Recommendations for Your Security Program, 2019](https://www.forrester.com/report/Top+Recommendations+For+Your+Security+Program+2019/-/E-RES151535),” testifies to this, describing SSI as a “win” for customers and businesses, and urged chief information security officers  (CISO) to “Empower your customers to control their own identities via self-sovereign identity.”
  > 
  > They can do this because exchanging verifiable digital credentials is at the heart of SSI. This ends the need for massive data silos, honeypots, and unsecured data repositories housed at countless corporations and organizations. Instead, anyone can hold secure and verifiable information about themselves

  > Credential issuers, holders, and verifiers are peers on an SSI network. Any person or organization can play any or all of the roles, creating a decentralized system for the exchange of trustworthy, digital credentials.
  > 
  > - Credential issuers determine what credentials to issue, what the credential means, and how they’ll validate the information they put in the credential.
  > - Credential holders determine what credentials they need and which they’ll employ in workflows to prove things about themselves.
  > - Credential verifiers determine what credentials to accept, and which issuers to trust.

  >  You can store your identities in a location where you can edit or delete them. After giving the location of your identities, the Indy platform lists your location with a globally identifiable name. When someone wants to read your identity data, the Indy platform points out the location of your identities. Let’s look into the details of how it works.
* [Hyperledger Welcomes Project Indy](https://www.hyperledger.org/blog/2017/05/02/hyperledger-welcomes-project-indy) 2017-05-02 {ANN)
  > Indy is all about giving identity owners independent control of their personal data and relationships. Indy is built so that the owner of the identity is structurally part of transactions made about that identity. Pairwise identifiers not only prevent correlation, but they stop third parties from transacting without the identity owner taking part since the identity owner is the only place pairwise identifiers can be correlated.

  > To manage patient’s self-sovereign identity, we leveraged the Hyperledger Indy blockchain framework to store patient’s decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and the schemas or format for each credential type. In contrast, the credentials containing patient data are stored “off-ledger” in each person’s wallet and accessible via a computer or smartphone. We used Hyperledger Aries as a middleware layer (API) to connect Hyperledger Indy with the front-end, which was developed using a JavaScript framework, ReactJS (Web Application) and React Native (iOS Application).
