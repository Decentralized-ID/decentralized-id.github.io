title: Interop Working Group - DIF 
description: Interoperability WG is a community effort to achieve decentralized identity interop.
excerpt: >
  Community collaboration and project management on Interoperability. Develop and publish definitions of success with respect to business interoperability, at the highest level. Defining points of protocol-defined touchpoints for maximum interchangeability of components at every layer; it is assumed that over time, that number will increase, not decrease. 
    
  Community collaboration and project management on interoperability goal to seek the greatest interoperability in the greater good, not to pick winners. Provide feedback, input documents, members, and guidance to working groups producing  standards, specifications, reference implementations and demonstrations hosted by community organizations including but not limited to IETF, W3C, W3C CCG, Hyperledger, Trust over IP.

    > For this call, you are encouraged to turn your video on. This is a good way to build rapport given we are a large, disparate group experiencing a lot of churn.
    > 
    > This document is live-edited DURING each call, and stable/authoritative copies live on our github repo under /agenda.md . Please note that we might not notice a pullrequest in time, but you are free to propose agenda items for future meetings via hackmd .
