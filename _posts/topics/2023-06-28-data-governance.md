title: "Data Governance and Self Sovereign Identity"
description: Individuals will gain the ability to own servers where their data is stored – and with it control their online identities.
excerpt: >
  We should absolutely all be taking care of the data that belongs to us, our data that we create, that we have a right to be able to control and share exactly as we choose. But we should also bear in mind the power of that data to help each of us, every day, benefit from the good that can come when it is shared and used to create a better world for us all.

  > It leverages data collection and networking and personal computing advances. It makes our data ours and authentic. It builds on all of the previous work done by countless engineers and inventors and dreamers. However, by being the last big problem it represents the final piece that brings together everything that came before it. The scope of the authentic data economy is literally everything in the human sphere. There is nothing that this won’t change. Trust will go everywhere and into everything. But most importantly, so will privacy.

  > 
  > [...] because data from their healthcare provider acquired into the server can be used to authenticate and assert that fact without the need to give any identity information. By using PDAs, apps that rely on sensitive data will be able to access this and stay “identity blind”.

  > In the digital age, individual privacy in the broadest sense is about control over protecting one’s personally identifiable information (PII), such as information about health, credit, shopping, or communication. But the types of information deemed ‘personally identifiable’ and the amount of control one has over them varies around the world.

  > A key part of this is continuity and longevity: a personal data store is for life, so the institutions providing personal data stores should be designed for decades (centuries, even). Whatever particular corporate form they take, legal safeguards relating to continuity and longevity of purpose need to be built into how they operate.

  > The data privacy/control issue isn’t new, but the attitude shift is. People care more, demand more, and the scale of change that has occurred due to the Covid-19 pandemic is major. As we live through times exposing such injustice and inequality, it's becoming evident that this personal data ecosystem needs to undergo a major revamp.
* [Self Sovereign Identity Systems](https://yathartharora.substack.com/p/self-sovereign-identity-systems) 2021-04-09 The Passion Pad
  > We should have the right to manage our identity, free of any country or the place where we live. By giving this right to the government or any central authority, we give them much more power. Separating data rights from the actual data is important. User should have the right to decide who should have the access to his/her data.

  > But there’s a difficult truth here. Much of the data is just plain wrong, wasteful, or at worst not compliant. We know this because businesses are spending boatloads of cash on fixing poor quality data and data compliance. And what’s the remedy? More data! More data sources, more attributes and profiles, more money. All fed by a new and increasingly sophisticated set of data APIs that are driving that growth.

  > Digital networks have centralized power over identities and information, creating problems for both markets and democracy. Does the solution require more shared agency over data?  What might that look like?  This panel discussion is structured around thought experiments to find solutions to this issue.
* [Self-Sovereign Identity – A Possibility for More Data Control for Users](https://dataethics.eu/self-sovereign-identity-a-possibility-for-more-data-control-for-users/) 2020-06-18 DataEthics.eu
  > But also, the general populations’ computer skills must be taken into account when designing the solution, along with legal considerations of whether individuals should be allowed to sell sensitive data, such as health data to third parties. If it is legal to monetize personal data, users can be tempted to share personal data in a way that might harm them later e.g. sharing health data and later being denied an insurance. Monetization might also create a gap in the society and the world, having rich people prioritize protecting their privacy while less fortunate citizens might feel like they have no other option than selling their data. Thoughts about the monetization of data need to be considered in a legal context as it has been done with the donation of blood, when creating a self-sovereign identity solution. Furthermore, safeguard measures must be made against discrimination like only providing identity for a selected few, and to ensure that everyone have equal access to creating a trustworthy digital identity.

  > Linking data together is about machine readability. Involved humans… need to understand. Do it through language. Humans like OCA because can understand data in different languages, makes sense for people. Human element. In that capture space. Want to refine OCA, take out some of the rules parts, masking overlay, conditional overlays, and get it away from OCA as architecture - it convolutes things. OCA only meant for making theings human-readable.

  > Personal data stores apply the same economic logic to transform the costs of producing data driven services. [Verified attributes](https://medium.com/mydex/unleashing-the-potential-of-verified-attributes-fe001e01b091) are the digital equivalents of Henry Ford’s standardised parts. By enabling one organisation to instantly re-use data verified by another organisation they eliminate the need for vast amounts of duplicated effort and rework (re-creating each data point from scratch or checking its details, provenance etc).

  > Credential Marketplace is quite high up the SSI stack but we want to start this discussion.
  > 1. What is Credential Marketplace?
  > 2. We have a Trust Triangle of Issuer-Holder-Verifier. This does not need any centralized entity except schema hosting.
  > 3. However, we want to solve the problem of discovery of Issuers and Verifiers.
  > 4. Example: I’m traveling to a new country. I need to get what healthcare VCs are needed to go there, in an automated way.
  > 5. How can we solve this without relaying on a centralized registry of Verifier requirements and Issuer capabilities?
  > 6. How it works
  > 7. In order to discover issuers / vc types, there should be a registration step where issuers/verifiers actively OR passively provide metadata about their capabilities.
  > 8. Credential Data — can contain some filters or constraints on the data from within the VC. E.g. As a Verifier, I only accept passport VC from only certain governments: only German nationals.
  > 9. VC Metadata
  > 10. Issuer Metadata
  > 11. Reputation mechanism for credential issuers
  > 12. Marketplace can also implement value transfer: paying for issuance by the verifier, for example. Even if they are part of different SSI ecosystems. This is optional but can help incentivize different participants.

According to Google (2020), 3% of company data is finance data when considered part of an entire company’s data lake. McKinsey [reports](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/how-companies-make-good-decisions-mckinsey-global-survey-results) that 90% of company decisions are based on finance data alone, the same 3% of data.

  > Last week, the UK Government passed what has been described by Jim Killock, director of the Open Rights Group, as the “most extreme mass surveillance law ever passed in a democracy”. The law, known officially as the Investigatory Powers Act, forces UK internet providers to store browsing histories — including domains visited — for one year, in case of police investigations. Unofficially, and in reference to its invasive powers, it has been nicknamed the Snooper’s Charter.

  > 
  > - Today: Users trust intermediaries to keep data safe, but they do not have sufficient control over their data
  > - Crypto: Transactions are public on the blockchain—which will not work with “real names”
  > - Tomorrow: New data architectures can give users privacy and control over their data

  > The main reason why vital information is not getting where it needs to be is that our data economy has evolved to be an organisation-centric ‘One User One Use’ (OUOU) system — whereas, thanks to the inner logic of data itself, it needs to operate as a ‘Many Users, Many Uses’ (MUMU) data ecosystem.
