  > Decentralized identity is an emerging concept becoming more popular for online consumers by eliminating the need to pass personal identifiable information (PII) to an ever-increasing number of companies. However, in practice, decentralized identity has only existed for a handful of years, and its potential is still being discovered. So how did we get here?

  > Decentralized Identity or Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) defines a new method for identity management and authentication. It removes the centralized aspects and puts the Identity subject in full control over its own identity. Decentralized Identity provides a solution for the increasing amount of database breaches, the lack of trust in any digital setting, and the increasingly difficult to comply with privacy legislation, such as GDPR.

  > Simply put, the old (centralized and federated models) the locus of control was between the other parties that could make decisions about me, whether I was in the picture or not. In the new model (self-sovereign identity), the user is put into the centre of his/her own locus of control. See above.

  > SSI is powerful yet elegant, bold yet familiar, and through it we can finally break free from the paradox of having to sacrifice security for user experience (or vice versa): we can have both, and at levels vastly improved over the status quo.

  > 1. Security - the identity information must be protected from unintentional disclosure;
  > 2. Control - the identity owner must be in control of who can see and access their data and for what purposes;
  > 3. Portability - the user must be able to use their identity data wherever they want and not be tied into a single provide

Trust, as always in security, is essential to this new class of relationships and must be established and then protected from abuse.

## Literature

* [WhitePaper] [Self Sovereign Identity](https://www.blockchainresearchinstitute.org/project/self-sovereign-identity) 2022-05-10 Phil Windley, Blockchain Research Institute
  > In this research, one of the leading experts and thought leaders in the digital identity space brings his latest thinking to enterprise innovators. He explains the value of the relationship view of identity, the nature of authentic digital relationships, the trust bases of identity systems, and the architecture of the identity metasystem, including decentralized identifier communication and the self-sovereign Internet. He then explores how to operationalize digital relationships and the potential of generative identities (e.g., verifiable credentials) and credential exchange. He concludes with a deep dive into self-sovereign identities in production: the UK National Health Service staff passport, Bonifii’s MemberPass for credit unions, the International Air Transport Association Travel Pass, and others. The project is a must-read for enterprise leaders looking to understand their opportunities in identity platforms and applications.

  > This paper analyses the SSI paradigm's conceptual characteristics and technical aspects and presents three use cases as examples. It becomes clear that SSI offers advantages in individual control, data security, and full portability of identities between different services. For example, forgeryand tamper-proof digital versions of important personal documents such as ID cards, passports, birth certificates or medical confirmations can be created. However, the use cases are not limited to personal SSI but can also be, for example, digital identities of organizations and physical objects in the context of IoT solutions. This is particularly important in connection with the comprehensive digitization of companies.

This will have a positive impact on the economic future of Germany and Europe while at the same time enhancing the private sphere of the individual.
