description: "Dock was founded with a mission to solve universal problems with existing data solutions: data silos and gatekeepers, untrusted and inaccurate information, incompatibilities across platforms, inefficiencies with verifying data, and lack of control and privacy for users."
excerpt: >
    There is a problem in the digital economy. Paper and PDFs are easy to fake. Verifying the authenticity of a document or certificate is slow and manual. And if you don't verify them, you risk fraud. That's why world-class organisations use Verifiable Credentials to verify documents instantly. Verifiable Credentials are documents that contain a crypto signature: a permanent stamp that allows anyone to confirm you issued that credential.
