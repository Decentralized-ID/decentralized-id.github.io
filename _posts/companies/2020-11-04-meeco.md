description: Zero Knowledge Proofs of the modern digital life for access, control, delegation and consent of identity and personal data
excerpt: >
  Meeco enables people (data subjects)to provide their own verified records and controlled consent. This API-of-Me allows Meeco to provide a meta-data driven attribute wallet with no knowledge of the data to any authenticated identity of a user,which in turn enables an auditable personal-event chain of data interactions at scale.
