description: "Accumulate’s story starts with the founding of Factom in 2014, a data publishing layer atop major blockchains."
excerpt: >
  The Accumulate protocol is based on many of the best concepts that came of the Factom protocol, including data and identity focus while combining the components in a new and unique configuration.

  The Accumulate protocol is designed by Paul Snow. Paul Snow is the Chief Blockchain Scientist at Inveniam and Defi Devs. Previously, he was the CEO and chief architect of the Factom protocol and co-author of the Factom White Paper, developing and implementing a “multi-leader” consensus algorithm for the blockchain network. Of note, he was founder and chief architect for DTRules, an open-source project providing decision table-based rules engines. He is listed as inventor on many of Factom’s 40+ patents, both issued and in progress, which serve as a foundation for Accumulate."
