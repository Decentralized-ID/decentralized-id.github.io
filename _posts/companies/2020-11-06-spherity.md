  > “To guarantee business continuity and protect data, we have built up an Information Security Management System (ISMS) in accordance with ISO/IEC 27001. For us as a company that deals directly with one of the most valuable assets that civilization has — identity — it was the logical pathway to give information security an appropriate degree of importance. Furthermore, we see it as our duty to our customers and employees to enter into this self-imposed obligation and to guarantee the highest possible level of information security — also as an investment in the deep mutual trust and ongoing cooperation with our clients.”

At its heart, this is what an identity wallet does, and we are proud to have developed two industry-leading, enterprise-grade identity wallets tailored to the documentation needs of the pharmaceutical industry.
