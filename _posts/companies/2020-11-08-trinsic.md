description: Making the world more accessible by empowering people with a digital identity thatâ€™s as legitimate as their real-world identity.
excerpt: >
    We make it easy to implement Self-Sovereign Identity based on Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs), a new digital identity standard. Our software is based on the open-source Hyperledger Aries project, to which we are a primary contributor.

    Together with proper governance, SSI enables, for the first time, the Trust over IP (ToIP) stack. Once trust can effectively be conveyed over IP, a tremendous number of opportunities arise in every industry vertical imaginable. We build the tools to help you capitalize on this opportunity.
