description: A Change In How We Handle Verification
excerpt: >
    Through a relatively new technology called verifiable credentials, it is possible for users to store personal information about themselves in a digital wallet on their phone. Organisations that need to verify some information about the user (e.g. age, address, membership, qualification, etc.) can send a request and, with user permission, get the information they need without having to store any personal data themselves.
