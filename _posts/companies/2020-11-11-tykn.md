description: We envision a world where identities are portable, private and secure, so that no one has to lose access to their identity ever again. Creating a future of opportunity.
excerpt: >
    Why is SSI better?

    - A secure and digital peer-to-peer channel is established between ID Issuer, ID Owner and ID Verifier. When credentials are exchanged not even the Self-Sovereign Identity system provider knows what is being exchanged. Credential issuing becomes simpler and faster.
    - SSI Credentials are tamper-proof through the use of cryptography.
    - They are private and under your control. SSI uses Selective Identity disclosure technology.
