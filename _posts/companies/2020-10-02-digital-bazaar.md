* [Digital Bazaar](https://digitalbazaar.com/) [[twitter](https://twitter.com/digitalbazaar)] [[github](https://github.com/digitalbazaar)]
  > We have over a decade of extensive experience with web standards at the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and the Internet Engineering Task Force including leadership roles in the Web Payments Interest Group as well the Verifiable Claims Task Force and the Credentials Community Group at the W3C.
  > 
  > Digital Bazaar is  deeply involved in the latest Web research and development standards groups including XHTML+RDFa, HTML5+RDFa, Semantic Web, OpenID Connect, and WebID.
  > 
  > Digital Bazaar also oversees technical development of core Web technologies across a wide variety of technology areas and has been a primary driving force in getting open identity and Linked Data technologies like JSON-LD and RDFa adopted at companies like Google, Microsoft, Yahoo!, Facebook and agencies in the US Federal Government.

* [Veres.io](https://veres.io/)
  > Veres is a credentialing platform that uses Verifiable Claims technology to digitize any credential that can be stored in a physical wallet. Veres enables more secure and efficient exchange of customer and employee credentials (ID cards, digital offers, receipts, tickets) across a wide variety of industries (government, education, healthcare, financial services). Other benefits include reduced risk and easier regulatory compliance.

* [NAFTA/CAFTA Proof of Concept Overview & Results](https://www.cbp.gov/sites/default/files/assets/documents/2019-Oct/Final-NAFTA-CAFTA-Report.pdf)
   >  A joint effort was spearheaded by Customs and Border Protection (CBP), Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and private sector organizations. The POC specifically tested the feasibility of the technology for receiving certificate of origin (CO) data and conducting free trade agreement (FTA) origin verifications.\

   > The goal of the NAFTA/CAFTA POC was to evaluate the application of Blockchain technology to the Entry Summary submission process with a specific focus on submitting the Certificate of Origin and enabling content integrity verification before it is requested by a CBP Import Specialist.

## Projects

Digital Bazaar founder, Manu Sporney, proposed the [W3C Credentials Community Group](http://web.archive.org/web/20181206060143/https://www.w3.org/community/credentials/charter-20140808/) in 2014.
  > "to forge a path for a secure, decentralized system of credentials that would empower both individual people and organizations on the Web to store, transmit, and receive digitally verifiable proof of qualifications and achievements." 

* [Veres.One](https://veres.one/summary/) A Globally Interoperable Network for Identity
  > Digital Bazaar is the Founder, and is the company that created the Veres One Blockchain technology and has been spearheading work on payments, identity, and blockchain for the Web for over 14 years. Manu Sporny, the CEO, and Dave Longley, the CTO, have co-invented numerous technologies like Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), Verifiable Credentials, Linked Data Signatures, the Web Ledger protocol, JSON-LD, and a variety of other technologies broadly deployed by large multinational organizations such as Google, Microsoft, Yandex, and the BBC.

* [Encrypted Data Vaults](https://digitalbazaar.github.io/encrypted-data-vaults/)
  > We store a significant amount of sensitive data online, such as personally identifying information (PII), trade secrets, family pictures, and customer information. The data that we store is often not protected in an appropriate manner. This specification describes a privacy-respecting mechanism for storing, indexing, and retrieving encrypted data at a storage provider. It is often useful when an individual or organization wants to protect data in a way that the storage provider cannot view, analyze, aggregate, or resell the data. This approach also ensures that application data is portable and protected from storage provider data breaches.
