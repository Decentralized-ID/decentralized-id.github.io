description: Jolocom builds global infrastructure to support decentralized digital identity management. 
excerpt: >
  The protocol logic encodes a granular, claim-based model of identity that is highly generalized and unrestrictive in scope in order to accommodate a multiplicity of potential use cases and broad range of subjects of identity (users), including individual persons as well non-person entities like organizations (e.g. companies, governmental bodies), IoT devices (e.g. hardware/software agents), and autonomous agents (e.g. DAOs).
