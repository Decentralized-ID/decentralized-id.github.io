title: "History (2010-2014) Personal Data: Emergence of a New Assets Class"
description: "During the first half of the 2010's we saw the emergence of personal data, as an asset class, and the dawn of modern identity schemes."
excerpt: >
  Your IDENTITY is at the root of your relationship with any service providing company, including the telecom companies. Honestly sir, the proper structure of the global network that emanates out of US agencies, laboratories, universities, offices, homes and increasingly pockets, is one based on universal ownership. Individuals must own the data attributes relating to their identities on the digital network. I am concerned that America has not figured out how to create administrative owners of the identity attributes that are implied by the governing structure of our nation. How can we structure the data processing relationships between producers-service providers-consumers when the structure of citizenship has not even been defined adequately enough to translate appropriately into our digital reality.

  > Abstract. Existing cryptographic realizations of privacy-friendly authentication mechanisms such as anonymous credentials, minimal disclosure tokens, selfblindable credentials, and group signatures vary largely in the features they offer and in how these features are realized. Some features such as revocation or de-anonymization even require the combination of several cryptographic protocols. These differences and the complexity of the cryptographic protocols hinder the deployment of these mechanisms for practical applications and also make it almost impossible to switch the underlying cryptographic algorithms once the application has been designed. In this paper, we aim to overcome this issue and simplify both the design and deployment of privacy-friendly authentication mechanisms. We define and unify the concepts and features of privacy-preserving attribute-based credentials (Privacy-ABCs) and provide a language framework in XML schema. Our language framework enables application developers to use Privacy-ABCs with all their features without having to consider the specifics of the underlying cryptographic algorithms—similar to as they do today for digital signatures, where they do not need to worry about the particulars of the RSA and DSA algorithms either.
