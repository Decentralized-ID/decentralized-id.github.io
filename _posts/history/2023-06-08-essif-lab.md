<strong>THE NGI ESSIF-LAB PROJECT ENDED ON <a href="https://www.ngi.eu/ngi-projects/essif-lab/">31 DECEMBER 2022</a></strong>

* [SIMPLER AND SAFER DIGITAL LIVING WITH SELF-SOVEREIGN IDENTITY](https://www.tno.nl/en/focus-areas/information-communication-technology/roadmaps/data-sharing/ssi/) 2022-07-28 TNO
  > On 1 November 2019 the EU Cascaded Funding project ‘eSSIF-Lab’ (European Self-Sovereign Identity Framework Lab) has started. In this project, EU funds will be made available to SMEs and start-ups that want to build or improve SSI components. The aim is to create a range of interoperable, open-source SSI components that people will actually use, not just in the Netherlands, but specifically also within Europe and perhaps world-wide

## NGI

Next Generation Internet (NGI) The Next Generation Internet (NGI) initiative aims to shape the development of the Internet of tomorrow into an Internet of humans that responds to people’s fundamental needs, including trust, security and inclusion, and reflects the values and the norms that we enjoy in Europe.<br><br>The NGI initiative aims to build the key technology blocks of a human-centric Internet, which gives end-users full control of their personal data. Through advanced technologies, new decentralised business and social models will ensure secure and trustworthy access for all.	https://www.ngi.eu/

  > Without a clear vision on identity, society will have no agency since the capability to produce future value (data) is not under regional, nor national, nor international regulated control.

  > Therefore it is important to have a good overview of what is happening in different parts of the world to see if we can not combine innovative solutions.

## eSSIF-Lab
* [The eSSIF-Lab Project](https://essif-lab.github.io/framework/docs/essifLab/)
  > The European Self-Sovereign Identity Lab (eSSIF-Lab) views itself as an ecosystem of parties that work together to make existing (and new) Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) technology into a scalable and interoperable infrastructure that businesses can use very easily for conducting (business) transactions with other businesses and individuals alike.
* [eSSIF-Lab Principles](https://essif-lab.github.io/framework/docs/essifLab-principles) 2022-10-06
  > [Trust](https://essif-lab.github.io/framework/docs/terms/trust) is not something that is given, but something that [parties](https://essif-lab.github.io/framework/docs/terms/party) (un)consciously assess, and decide about, and changes over time. Since parties are autonomous, their trust is highly subjective. As a consequence, the idea of having 'trusted registries', 'trusted issuers' that do not take this subjectivity into account basically act as [(centralized) authorities](https://essif-lab.github.io/framework/docs/terms/authority), denying that parties are autonomous. While we acknowledge that such ideas (have a right to) exist, we do not follow them.
* [eSSIF-Lab Project](https://essif-lab.github.io/framework/docs/essifLab-project) 2022-09-16 eSSIF Lab
  > The objectives of the eSSIF-Lab project itself include:
  > -  empower European and other citizens by providing them with new means that help them to electronically negotiate and conduct transactions. These new means will make electronic transactions fast and safe both in the Internet and in physical life, and eliminate logins.
  > -  empower European and other organizations and governments by providing new means to speed up, secure and automate transactions with citizens, customers, suppliers and partners, resulting in tens of billions of euros savings annually on administrative costs in Europe.
  > -  **ensure these new means support organizations and citizens to exercise their rights and fulfil their duties under the GDPR.**
  > -  stimulate these new means foster inclusiveness.
  > -  stimulate the pervasive use of new business ecosystem paradigms with thousands of new jobs, many new job categories and new business opportunities for existing and new European companies.

  > The SSI mandate service is a generic and holistic approach to provide and request mandates. Mandates are SSI credentials signed by the dependent that can be requested by either the dependent or authorized representative. These credentials can be used to prove to a verifier that the authorized representative is authorized to act for specific actions on behalf of the dependent.

  > The concept of SSI was designed with the citizen and privacy in mind. However, existing implementations lack user-friendliness (e.g. showing hash codes to users), creating potential barriers in users’ adoption. OnboardSSI focuses on providing a secure and user-friendly wallet solution creating an easier way for citizens to manage their identity.
