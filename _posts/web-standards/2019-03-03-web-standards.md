title:  Web Standards and the Emerging Decentralized ID Stack
excerpt: >
  If you’re willing to put up with a lot of work for incremental improvements then step up and join a standard. Whether that is a (relatively) fast moving standard group like OASIS (www.oasis-open.org) or a slower but more international group like ISO you will learn. You’ll also benefit from working with experts. These experts donate their time and are more than happy to provide ideas, guidance, and leadership.
