description: authentication built on top of OAuth 2.0 and the use of Claims to communicate information about the End-User
excerpt: >
  OpenID Connect 1.0 is a simple identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol. It enables Clients to verify the identity of the End-User based on the authentication performed by an Authorization Server, as well as to obtain basic profile information about the End-User in an interoperable and REST-like manner.
