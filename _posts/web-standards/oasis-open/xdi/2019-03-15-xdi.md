title: XDI (XRI Data Interchange)
excerpt: >
  XDI is a technology for modeling, storing, and manipulating data.
  
  It fits into a similar category of technologies as JSON, XML and RDF, but also has a number of properties that distinguishes it.
  
  XDI is a graph-based data model. This means that all data is expressed using nodes and arcs in a graph. At a minimum, a graph consists of a single node, called the common root node.

## Intro

The XNS Public Trust Organization was founded in July 2000, shortly after International Planetwork Conference. -[xdi.org - History](http://xdi.org/?page_id=13)
  > to promote the concept of individuals owning their own digital identity and data based on a nascent technology being produced by two Technical Committees at OASIS: XRI (Extensible Resource Identifier) and XDI (Extensible Data Interchange).

* [The Dataweb: An Introduction to XDI](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/download.php/6434/wd-xdi-intro-white-paper-2004-04-12.pdf) - A White Paper for the OASIS XDI Technical Committee v2, *April 12, 2004* 
  > XDI (XRI Data Interchange) is a new service for generalized distributed data sharing and mediation usingXRIs (Extensible Resource Identifiers), a URI-compatible abstract identifier scheme developed by the OASIS XRI Technical Committee. The goal of XDI is to enable data from any data source to be identified, exchanged, linked, and synchronized into a machine-readable dataweb using XML documents just as content from any content source can linked into the human-readable Web using HTML documents today. Because the controls needed to mediate access and usage of shared data can be built right into every XDI link, the emergence of a global Dataweb has the potential to do for trusted data interchange what the Web did for open content exchange.
  >
  > This white paper presents several examples of classic cross-domain data sharing problems, explains how the Dataweb model can provide a generalized solution, and describes the key objectives of the newlyformed OASIS XDI Technical Committee ([http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/xdi](http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/xdi)).

* [DID Whitepaper](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot2-id2020/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/DID-Whitepaper.md)
  > In April 2015 the XDI.org trustees formed the XDI Registry Working Group (XRWG) to transition XDI registry infrastructure from a centralized model to a new decentralized blockchain-based model.
  > 
  > The charter of the XRWG includes the following principles:
  >
  > * Maximum interoperability.   
  > * Minimum viable centralization. 
  > * Critical infrastructure. The XDI Registry must provide for a high level of reliability, stability, scalability, security, sustainability and other requirements typical of critical internet infrastructure.
  > * Sovereign identity. The XDI Registry should enable any XDI authority (person or organization) to fully administer its own registry and/or its own entry in an xdi.org-specified registry, without the need to rely on any particular external administrative authority.
  > * Neutrality. The XDI Registry should be available to all members of the public and should not discriminate against any party that wishes to use it for any lawful purpose.
  >
  > [...]
  >
  > A DID architecture should focus on the set of components that Mr. Gupta refers to as "the minimum required for people to be able to do business (or other critical functions) together".
  >
  >**A Decentralized Identifier (DID) Registry and Discovery Service**
  >
  > This "minimum required" is defined by a union of the proposed requirements identified by the W3C Credential Community Group, the XDI.org Registry Working Group, and the Rebooting the Web of Trust group. It consists of three functions that can be addressed by a combination of blockchain and DHT technology:
  >
  > * A DID registration function
  > * A discovery function - enables looking up a registered DID in the blockchain
  > * A master key recovery function

## Project Danube

Markus Sabadello began working on Project Danube [around 2010](https://web.archive.org/web/20101221105543/http://projectdanube.org/)

>This is an open-source project offering software for identity and personal data services on the Internet. The core of this project is an XDI-based Personal Data Store - a semantic database for your personal data, which always remains under your control. Applications on top of this database include the Federated Social Web, the selective sharing of personal data with organizations, and much more.
