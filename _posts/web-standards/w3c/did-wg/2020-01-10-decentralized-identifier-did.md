  > A DID architecture should focus on the set of components that Mr. Gupta refers to as "the minimum required for people to be able to do business (or other critical functions) together".
  >
  >**A Decentralized Identifier (DID) Registry and Discovery Service**
  >
  > This "minimum required" is defined by a union of the proposed requirements identified by the W3C Credential Community Group, the XDI.org Registry Working Group, and the Rebooting the Web of Trust group. It consists of three functions that can be addressed by a combination of blockchain and DHT technology:
  >
  > * A DID registration function
  > * A discovery function that enables looking up a registered DID in the blockchain
  > * A master key recovery function
