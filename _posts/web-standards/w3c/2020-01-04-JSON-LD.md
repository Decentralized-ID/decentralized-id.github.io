  The Semantic Web isn't just about putting data on the web. It is about making links, so that a person or machine can explore the web of data.  With linked data, when you have some of it, you can find other, related, data
   
  Like the web of hypertext, the web of data is constructed with documents on the web.

The URIs identify any kind of object or concept
