description: Allows users to register and authenticate on websites or mobile apps using an "authenticator" instead of a password.
excerpt: >
  The Web Authentication Working Group will develop recommendation-track specifications defining an API, as well as signature and attestation formats which provide an asymmetric cryptography-based foundation for authentication of users to Web Applications.
  
  Overall goals include obviating the use of shared secrets, i.e. passwords, as authentication credentials, facilitating multi-factor authentication support as well as hardware-based key storage while respecting the Same Origin Policy (SOP) by default and allowing for explicit, constrained SOP relaxation.
