* [Substrate Verifiable Credentials Workshop](https://substrate.dev/substrate-verifiable-credentials/#/) - Learn to build blockchains with Parity Substrate
* [Verifiable Credential API](https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/CEFDIGITALEBSI/Verifiable+Credential+API) CEF Digital Connecting Europe
  > The Verifiable Credential API provides a Core Service of the EBSI platform providing the capability of creating W3C credentials ready for signing and validating W3C Verifiable Credentials.
* [SolidVC : a decentralized framework for Verifiable Credentials on the web](https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/121667)
  > SolidVC is a decentralized Verifiable Credentials platform built with the open protocols of the Web. It is implemented on top of Solid, a Web framework developed at MIT in 2016 that allows decentralized applications to interact with personal user data to provide services in an access controlled environment.
* [Blockcerts V3 Proposal - Verifiable Credentials & Decentralized Identifiers](https://community.blockcerts.org/t/blockcerts-v3-proposal-verifiable-credentials-decentralized-identifiers/2221)
  > As the standards around Verifable Credentials are starting to take form, different favors of "verifiable credentials-like" data structures need to make necessary changes to leverage on the rulesets outlined and constantly reviewed by knowledgeable communities such as the W3C. The purpose of this paper is to identify all of the changes needed for Blockcerts to comply with the Verifiable Credentials (VCs) and Decentralized Identifers (DIDs) standards and to expand upon the additional benefits of using a blockchain in combination with Verifiable Credentials. This paper is meant to act as an explainer in which a formal specification can be created. This paper proposes multiple implementation options for several properties. The intention is that we can engage the Blockcerts / Verifiable Credential communities and see what fts best.
* [mattr.global/Verifiable Credential based Authentication via OpenID Connect](https://mattr.global/verifiable-credential-based-authentication-via-openid-connect/)
  > At MATTR, we’ve been working hard on an exciting opportunity with the Government of British Columbia (BC Gov) in Canada. In June 2019, the BC Gov Verifiable Organisations Network team put out a “Code With Us” development bounty to integrate KeyCloak, their chosen enterprise Identity and Access Management (IAM) solution, with a new W3C standard called Verifiable Credentials. This work led to a solution that enables the use of Verifiable Credentials (VC) as a means of authentication that is interoperable with OpenID Connect (OIDC). We call this work VC-AuthN-OIDC. The output is an adapter that bridges these standards and enables a whole new set of capabilities through a simple extension of most modern IAM solutions.
* [Blockstack and Verifiable Credentials - Paris P2P Festival](https://p2p.paris/gen/attADzQJ92rNIv6B3-Blockstack_and_Verifiable_Credentials_-_Paris_P2P_Festival_.pdf)
  > • Keep auth and smart contracts on-chain\
  > • Keep encrypted data off-chain\
  > • Wrap everything in an easy JavaScript API
* [IBM Verify Credentials](https://docs.info.verify-creds.com)
  > With IBM Verify Credentials and our alpha components, you can begin your journey of exploring the benefits of decentralized identity. We have provided an interactive experience centered around the challenge of proving your identity while opening a financial account. Additionally, we will walk you through the development of your first end-to-end decentralized identity solution.
* [Verifiable credentials and libp2p](https://discuss.libp2p.io/t/verifiable-credentials-and-libp2p/206)
  > Hi - we’re looking into libp2p as a network stack for our application and exploring how we could integrate verifiable credentials (https://w3c.github.io/vc-data-model/ 2) infrastructure. A basic use case is that of a node being challenged to provide some specific credential to join the network. The bootstrap node handling the incoming connection should verify the credential with the issuer and complete the connection/bootstrap or terminate it.
* [Open Badges are Verifable Credentials](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/WebOfTrustInfo/rebooting-the-web-of-trust-spring2018/blob/master/final-documents/open-badges-are-verifiable-credentials.pdf)
  > The Blockcerts Open Badges Draft Extension introduced a verifcation method based on those used by Verifable Credentials for the specifc use case of blockchain-anchored credentials. This paper expands that work and proposes a new option that can reside alongside existing Open Badges verifcation methods.
* [Workday Credentials & WayTo™ By Workday](https://credentials.workday.com/docs/overview/)
  > An issuer is any entity that wishes to relinquish and publicly attest to the veracity of data pertaining to a user. Public attestation comes in the form of a digital signature. When an issuer offers a credential to a user, Workday Credentials cryptographically signs the data in each credential with the issuer's private key before offering it to the user. The signing key's corresponding public key is written to a public ledger and is declared as belonging to the issuer, so that anyone can use that public key to verify the signature embedded in a user's digital credentials and establish trust in a credential's authenticity.

## Code

* [Identity.com Verifiable Credential Library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@identity.com/credential-commons)
  > This Javascript Library provides functionality around Verifiable Credentials (VC), a W3C standard. Enables Validators to issue, Credential Wallets to verify, filter and Requesters to verify credentials.
* [EDCI-Data-Model](https://github.com/european-commission-europass/EDCI-Data-Model)
  > The European Commission is developing the Europass Digital Credentials Infrastructure (EDCI) – a set of tools, services and software to support the issuance of authentic, tamper-proof digital credentials (such as qualifications and other learning achievements) across Europe. The EDCI is being developed as part of ongoing work to implement the new Europass Framework for supporting transparency of skills and qualifications in Europe.
* [gautamdhameja/substrate-verifiable-credentials](https://github.com/gautamdhameja/substrate-verifiable-credentials)
  > A minimal Substrate runtime for verifiable credentials' issuance and verification.
* [bcgov/TheOrgBook](https://github.com/bcgov/TheOrgBook)
  > A public repository of verifiable claims about organizations. A key component of the Verifiable Organization Network.
* [bcgov/vc-authn-oidc](https://github.com/bcgov/vc-authn-oidc)
