title       : "Self Sovereign Identity (SSI)"
excerpt: >
  It would seem that Christopher Allen's The Path to Self-Sovereign Identity is still the most comprehensive article on the subject of Self Sovereign Identity. It outlines some of the underlying history, and introduces 10 Principles of Self-Sovereign Identity, born from the collective thoughts on identity leading to it.

  Considerable additional material has been created on the subject since then, including some helpful criticism on the principles. Some of initial thoughts have been organized in evolution-of-ssi.

This directory was born from [WebOfTrustInfo/self-sovereign-identity](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/self-sovereign-identity), *the original* SSI repository. 

It would seem that Christopher Allen's [The Path to Self-Sovereign Identity](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/self-sovereign-identity/blob/master/ThePathToSelf-SovereignIdentity.md) is still the most comprehensive article on the subject of Self Sovereign Identity. It outlines some of the underlying history, and introduces [10 Principles of Self-Sovereign Identity](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/self-sovereign-identity/blob/master/self-sovereign-identity-principles.md), born from the collective thoughts on identity leading to it. 

Considerable additional material has been created on the subject since then, including some helpful criticism on the principles. Some of initial thoughts have been organized in [evolution-of-ssi](/literature/self-sovereign-identity/evolution-of-ssi/).

  > Identification document (ID) is a crucial part of every individual’s life, in that it is often a prerequisite for accessing a variety of services — ranging from creating a bank account to enrolling children in school to buying alcoholic beverages to signing up for an email account to voting in an election — and also a proof of simply being.

  > SSI is on the extreme end of the digital identity spectrum. Its focus is putting control back in the hands of you, the user. But SSI is not the only way to skin a cat.

  > Identity professionals continue to have questions about self-sovereign identity (SSI). In this post, I answer a few questions that Susan Morrow raised about the commercial viability, security, privacy, and desired user experience of SSI.

  > Simply put, the old (centralized and federated models) the locus of control was between the other parties that could make decisions about me, whether I was in the picture or not. In the new model (self-sovereign identity), the user is put into the centre of his/her own locus of control. See above.
