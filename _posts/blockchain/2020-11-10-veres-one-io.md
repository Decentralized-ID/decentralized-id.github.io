* [Veres One - Summary](https://veres.one/summary/)
  > The Veres One Project envisions a world where people and organizations control their identifiers and their identity data. The Veres One Blockchain is a fit-for-purpose blockchain optimized for identity on the Web. The network ecosystem is designed to be self-sufficient through the use of an innovative operational and funding model. The operational model ensures openness, prevents attacks against the network, and financially rewards individuals and organizations that choose to run software to ensure the security of the network. Human dignity demands that every individual be able to participate equally in our increasingly digital society. That means everyone deserves the ability create and administer unique, globally resolvable identifiers. For that reason, the network is global and open to the public; anyone may participate.

> The Veres One Community Group, housed at the W3C, directs the development and management of the Veres One Network.
> 
> Community Group decisions are made by consensus and sent to the Board of Governors for review and voting. The Board of Governors vote to accept or reject Community Group decisions based on their compliance with the Veres One Mission. Meetings are open to the public and minutes are made available in a public github repository. - [About](https://veres.one/about/)

* [Veres One Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/veres-one/)
  > The mission of the Veres One Project is to facilitate the creation of open standards, software, and provide the governance to enable anyone in the world to create and manage their own decentralized identifiers.

* [Nodes](https://veres.one/)
  > A Node on the Veres One Network contains a record of every event that has has made its way into the Veres One Blockchain over time. It is connected to many of the other Nodes in the Network and can "gossip" events to other Nodes in the Network. When a Node receives an event, if the Node is an Elector, it may suggest that an event is included in the blockchain. If 2/3rds of the Network sees the event, and it is valid, then the event will be included in the blockchain.

* [Creating a DID on Veres One](https://veres.one/download/)
  > Requirements: Node v8.6+\
  > Install did-client\
  > Install the Decentralized Identifier client:\
  > `mkdir did-client`\
  > `cd did-client`\
  > `npm install did-client`\
  > Generate a Decentralized Identifier:
  > `./node_modules/did-client/did generate --register`\
  > Information related to your Decentralized Identifier will be stored in the following directory:\
  > `ls $HOME/.testdid/`
