title: Cosmos Network - Internet of Blockchains
description: Cosmos is a decentralized network of independent parallel blockchains, each powered by consensus algorithms like Tendermint consensus.
excerpt: >
  In other words, Cosmos is an ecosystem of that can scale and interoperate with each other. Before Cosmos, blockchains were siloed and unable to communicate with each other. They were hard to build and could only handle a small amount of per second. Cosmos solves these problems with a new technical vision. In order to understand this vision we need to go back to the fundamentals of blockchain technology.

## Building with Cosmos

* [Commercio Network](https://commercio.network/) - Commercio.network is “The Documents Blockchain” that ALLOWS  companies to create identities, sign and exchange business documents among its participants.
* [Ockam](https://www.ockam.io/) (built w Tendermint \ Cosmos compatible)
* [NYM](https://nymtech.net/)
  > Nym uses anonymous authentication credentials based on the [Coconut](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.07344) signature scheme to enable privacy-enhanced data transfer and decentralized identity. Nym credentials can embed the data needed for a given service (including zero-knowledge proofs of private data), and these credentials are validated in a decentralized and public manner without linking a user to the service they want to access.
