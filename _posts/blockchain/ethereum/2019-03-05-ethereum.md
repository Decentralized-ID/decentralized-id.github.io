* [Blockchain Use Cases - Digital Identity](https://consensys.net/blockchain-use-cases/digital-identity/) Consensys
  > The traditional identity systems of today are fragmented, insecure, and exclusive. Blockchain enables more secure management and storage of digital identities by providing unified, interoperable, and tamper-proof infrastructure with key benefits to enterprises, users, and IoT management systems.
  > - How does identity work today?
  > - Why do we need blockchain for identity?
  > - How do decentralized digital identities work on Ethereum?
  > - What are the use cases of blockchain in identity management?
  > - What are the benefits of decentralized identity?
* [On-Demand: Credential Management for Government and Enterprise on Blockchain](https://pages.consensys.net/credential-management-for-government-and-enterprise) - The future of access controls and credential management on Blockchain
  > Security and identity are complex and ever-evolving issues for enterprise and government systems alike. Blockchain-based solutions are providing exceptional utility in solving issues of identity and digital systems. This webinar—titled Credential Management for Government and Enterprise—offers a high-level overview of where identity management is today, how we got here, and how we can transition to the next stage and beyond while making sure we leverage existing architecture and infrastructure.

## Ethereum Enterprise Alliance

- [World’s Largest Blockchain Initiative Launches Three Working Groups](https://entethalliance.org/worlds-largest-blockchain-initiative-launches-three-working-groups/)
  > NEW YORK, N.Y., USA – December 19, 2017 ––The Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA), the world’s largest open-source blockchain initiative, launched today three new member-driven working groups in digital identity, energy and multiplatform interoperability. 
- [Enterprise Ethereum Alliance - Enterprise EthereumClient Specification V215 October 2018](https://entethalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/EEA_Enterprise_Ethereum_Client_Specification_V2.pdf)
  > The Infrastructure Contracts and Standards sublayer shows emerging standards outside theEnterprise Ethereum core specification. The components in this layer provide enablers for the applications built on top of them.Role Based Access Control (RBAC) defines methods for authentication and restricting system access to authorized users, potentially realized through smart contracts.Network Governance methods control which entities can join the network and hence assist withsafeguarding exchanges.Token standards provide common interfaces and methods along with best practices. These include[ERC-20], [ERC-223], [ERC-621], [ERC-721], and [ERC-827].
- [Enterprise Ethereum Alliance Permissioned Blockchains Specification v2](https://entethalliance.github.io/client-spec/chainspec.html) EEA Editor's Draft 01 November 2020
  > This document, the Enterprise Ethereum Blockchain Specification, defines requirements for Enterprise Ethereum blockchains to ensure they can be processed interoperably by Enterprise Ethereum clients that conform to the Enterprise Ethereum Client specification [EEA-client]. Its primary intended audience is operators of Enterprise Ethereum blockchains.\
  > [...]\
  > **Credential Management Sublayer**\
  > Credentials, in the context of Enterprise Ethereum blockchains, refer to an individual’s cryptographic private keys, which are associated with that user’s Ethereum account.\
  > [...]\
  > This section presents a smart contract based registry, to provide on-chain validation that a particular Ethereum accounts or nodes is owned by a participating organization in an Enterprise Ethereum blockchain.\
  > [...]\
  > An Organization Registry follows the design outlined below.\
  > ORGIDS-300: Enterprise Ethereum Blockchains MAY implement a smart contract based Organization Registry that provides cryptographic bindings between Ethereum accounts and their owning organization with identity proofs.

## ERC-EIP

Identity related ERC-EIP

* [ERC: Lightweight Identity #1056](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/1056)   
  > This ERC describes a standard for creating and updating identities with a limited use of blockchain resources. An identity can have an unlimited number of delegates and attributes associated with it. Identity creation is as simple as creating a regular key pair ethereum account, which means that it's fee (no gas costs) and all ethereum accounts are valid identities. Furthermore this ERC is fully DID compliant.
* [ERC1056 ❤ ERC780 — an open identity and claims protocol for Ethereum](https://medium.com/uport/erc1056-erc780-an-open-identity-and-claims-protocol-for-ethereum-aef7207bc744)

* [ERC-1484 Digital Identity Aggregator](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/1495) 
  > A protocol for aggregating digital identity information that's broadly interoperable with existing, proposed, and hypothetical future digital identity standards.
* [EIP-1078](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/ed621645c8f3bc5756492f327cda015f35d9f8da/EIPS/eip-1078.md)
  > This presents a method to replace the usual signup/login design pattern with a minimal ethereum native scheme, that doesn’t require passwords, backing up private keys nor typing seed phrases.
