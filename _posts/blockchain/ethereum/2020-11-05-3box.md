  > Ethereum Profiles makes it simple for users to create a reusable profile for their Ethereum address which can easily be shared with dapps to simplify the onboarding experience and create a more frictionless, social web3 dapp ecosystem. Ethereum Profiles allows Ethereum users to collect and control their information on the distributed web using their existing Ethereum wallets.

  > Weâ€™re excited to announce the release of 3box-js 1.1.0 which includes new features such as local and network caching and a GraphQL endpoint. Together these features work to improve performance and stability by reducing the average log-in time for users, reducing API response times for getProfile, and allowing developers to be much more efficient in writing their public profile queries.

- [Shareable PublicÂ Profiles](https://medium.com/3box/shareable-public-profiles-94387c0d641e) 
  > Previously user profiles were only viewable to the profile owner when logged-in to 3box.io on a web3-enabled browser, and to third-party apps using the getProfile() API method and rendering details in their appâ€™s UI. Now with the addition of shareable profiles, anyone can view your public profile by clicking your profile URL.
- [A More Human Web3 ActivityÂ Feed](https://medium.com/3box/a-more-human-web3-activity-feed-2d3b8f62afec)

  > In addition to making onboarding more convenient and seamless, verified email addresses also respect user privacy. Emails are saved to a userâ€™s private 3Box profile, giving the user full control of their contact information. Verified emails are only shared with applications that the user explicitly approves.

* [Introduction to the Ceramic Protocol](https://medium.com/ceramic/introduction-to-the-ceramic-protocol-8d56951ae3f)
  > For self-sovereign identity and to enable user-managed access control, 3Box uses Ceramicâ€™s 3ID DID method which allows users to control their identity, information, and services using all of their existing private wallet keys.

* [Identity-centric interoperability with the Ceramic Protocol â€“ Joel Thorstensson â€“ Webinar 57](https://ssimeetup.org/identity-centric-interoperability-ceramic-protocol-joel-thorstensson-webinar-57/)
  > Ceramic is a new permissionless protocol for creating and accessing unstoppable documents that serve as the foundation for a connected, interoperable web without silos. Joel Thorstensson is the founder and CTO of 3Box and the primary author of the ceramic protocol as well as several Ethereum standards for identity and will provide a conceptual and technical intro to Ceramic.\
  > [...]\
  > Ceramic uses DIDs (Decentralized Identifiers), IPLD (InterPlanetary Linked Data), signed messages, and blockchain anchoring to create a trusted and shared graph of verifiable documents. While flexible, these documents are especially well-suited for self-sovereign identity systems, user-centric data ecosystems, and open web services.\

* [Technical Specification](https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/ceramic/blob/master/SPECIFICATION.md)
  > Ceramic is a decentralized protocol that enables the creation of mutable, tamper-resistant, smart documents on a worldwide public network. Smart documents are achieved through a combination of digital signatures, document update rules, and blockchain anchoring. A Ceramic document is a flexible data structure that can be used to represent a wide variety of things such as self-sovereign identities, specific pieces of data or content, media files, schemas, policies for data access control, verifiable credentials, agreements between multiple parties, etc. The protocol doesnâ€™t rely on any particular blockchain system, instead it utilizes [IPLD](https://ipld.io/) to encode document changes into a hash linked data structure, called a Merkle DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph), and anchors those updates into a blockchain which provides strict ordering to the content of a given document. As a result, Ceramic can be conceptualized as network of individual "doc-chains." Verifying the state of a particular document only requires a user to sync the data of the given document, and the user does not need to sync the state of the entire network as is the case with all blockchain networks that maintain a global state (i.e. Bitcoin, Ethereum). A node in the Ceramic network can thus choose to only pin the documents it cares about. This means that there is no global ledger of documents.
