A listing of any Github Repositories for Ethereum Based Decentralized Identity specifications and applications.


## EIP - ERC

* [ethereum/EIPs/issues/1056](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/1056) - ERC: Lightweight Identity
  - This ERC describes a standard for creating and updating identities with a limited use of blockchain resources. An identity can have an unlimited number of delegates and attributes associated with it. Identity creation is as simple as creating a regular key pair ethereum account, which means that it's fee (no gas costs) and all ethereum accounts are valid identities. Furthermore this ERC is fully DID compliant.
* [ethereum/EIPs/issues/780](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/780) - EIP-780 Ethereum Claims Registry
* [ethereum/EIPs / eip-712.md](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/f29527ab39357548b06b29e937a48f06ae099de7/EIPS/eip-712.md) - EIP712
  - This is a standard for hashing and signing of typed structured data
* [ethereum/EIPs/issues/1495](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/1495) - ERC-1484 Digital Identity Aggregator
  - A protocol for aggregating digital identity information that's broadly interoperable with existing, proposed, and hypothetical future digital identity standards.
* [ethereum/EIPs / eip-1078.md](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/ed621645c8f3bc5756492f327cda015f35d9f8da/EIPS/eip-1078.md) - EIP-1078
  - This presents a method to replace the usual signup/login design pattern with a minimal ethereum native scheme, that doesnâ€™t require passwords, backing up private keys nor typing seed phrases.
