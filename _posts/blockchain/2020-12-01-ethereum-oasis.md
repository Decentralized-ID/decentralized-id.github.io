## EEA Community Projects 
**Ethereum Oasis:** [GitHub](https://github.com/eea-oasis) • [Baseline](https://www.baseline-protocol.org/) • [Docs](https://docs.baseline-protocol.org/) • [Twitter](https://twitter.com/baselineproto) • [Slack](https://communityinviter.com/apps/ethereum-baseline/join-us)

* [EEA Community Projects](https://entethalliance.org/EEACommunityProjects/)
  > The EEA Community Projects provide support for open source development of code, APIs, standards, and reference implementations.  Its foundation is the former Ethereum OASIS Open Project, which represents 25+ years of OASIS experience in collaborative development and its global reputation and relationships. The work is led by EEA, managed under the OASIS Open process, and driven by the community at large.
* [Ethereum OASIS Open Project Transitions to New EEA Community Projects](https://www.oasis-open.org/2021/06/29/eea-and-oasis-join-forces-to-provide-nexus-for-open-source-development-of-ethereum-standards/) 2021-06-29 Oasis Open
  > The move leverages the strengths of both standards bodies, building on EEA’s leadership role in Ethereum standards for business while continuing to rely on OASIS’ expertise in supporting open source and open standards development. The formation of EEA Community Projects signals to the world that there is now a central location where Ethereum-related business standards are developed and new projects are advanced.
* [OASIS Introduces Open Projects Program to Bridge Open Source and Standards Development](https://www.oasis-open.org/2019/05/08/introducing-open-projects/) 2019-05-08
  > OASIS, a global nonprofit consortium, today announced the launch of Open Projects, the first-of-its-kind program that creates a more transparent and collaborative future for open source and standards development. Open Projects gives communities the power to develop what they choose–APIs, code, specifications, reference implementations, guidelines– in one place, under open source licenses, with a path to recognition in global policy and procurement.

  > Continuing this item from the 2022 roadmap with Milestones 3 to 5. BRI-3 is critical to advance the Baseline Protocol standard to a full project specification by achieving key 2023 roadmap items such as the interoperability fest, which requires at least two functional reference implementations that can show standard compliance including interoperability, and a roadshow which would feature key use cases to selected audiences across the world.

  > Today’s release of Baseline Protocol v0.1 represents a significant milestone, because it provides a set of standard interfaces for developers to implement solutions easily and for vendors to provide their own modules that comply with the specification. Official OASIS standards development based on the v0.1 reference implementation will commence in September.

  > On one hand, it is designed with confidentiality, privacy, and data security in mind. The mixture of technologies is aligned in such a way that none of your sensitive data is leaked. This data stays safely with you and your counter-parties. Outsiders looking in will not know what process is being executed, who are the actors, or what goods are exchanged.
  > 
  > On the other hand, the protocol is designed with complex interactions in mind. Inter-company business processes involve many stops and checks and are never straightforward. The protocol will allow you to describe and accommodate your business process however complex it is.

  > Today, EY and ConsenSys announced the formation of the Baseline Protocol in collaboration with Microsoft. The Baseline Protocol is an open source initiative that combines advances in cryptography, messaging, and blockchain to deliver secure and private business processes at low cost via the public Ethereum Mainnet. The protocol will enable confidential and complex collaboration between enterprises without leaving any sensitive data on-chain. The work will be governed by the Ethereum-Oasis Project, which is managed by OASIS and funded by the Ethereum Foundation and the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance.
