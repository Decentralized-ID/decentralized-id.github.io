* [Ontology Builds on Polkadot to Accelerate Adoption Of Decentralized Identity Solution](https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-builds-on-polkadot-to-accelerate-adoption-of-decentralized-identity-solution-acf7b8357ee)
  > Developed over the past couple of months, the Ontology [parachain](https://github.com/siovanus/DID-substrate) currently consists of a DID Substrate pallet, with plans for further integration of other custom components. Further plans for the Ontology parachain include:
  >
  > Ontology OScore — an off-chain DID authorization mechanism to manage wallet-identity relationships and provide ID-based credit scores for on-chain actions related to digital assets. The integration of Ontology’s distributed data exchange framework (DDXF), permitting both token association and data tokenization. Expanding DID’s use cases from users to also include data and resources, providing authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) for DID based resource instances via on-chain data access control with data-tokens (tokenization), and association of its value. DDXF provides on-chain AAA for data interoperability cross systems.

  > [Ontology](https://ont.io/), the high performance, open-source blockchain specializing in digital identity and data, has announced today an integration with [Chainalysis](https://www.chainalysis.com/), the blockchain analysis company.
  > 
  > Ontology will utilize Chainalysis’s compliance and investigative solutions, KYT (Know Your Transaction) and Reactor, to enhance trust, provide a safer experience to traders, and combat illicit activity through transaction monitoring and tracing.
* [Lower Your Collateral Requirements & Loan Interests with OScore](https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/lower-your-collateral-requirements-loan-interests-with-oscore-fb2c835a9998)
  > [OScore](https://ocredit.io/), the first credit score for the decentralized world built with Ontology’s Decentralized Identity has officially launched. For simplicity, consider OScore an on-chain reputational system that supports cross-chain interaction with verifiable credentials on the Ontology blockchain, hence eliminating third-party verification programs from the process. Once a user authorizes their digital financial data, Ontology’s OScore system automatically generates a quantifiable credit score while ensuring a user’s privacy is fully protected and controlled by themselves.

### Identity Repos
* [ontology-DID](https://github.com/ontio/ontology-DID) Ontology decentralized identification protocol based on W3C DID specifications.
  > Ontology DID(Also: ONT ID) is a decentralized identification protocol which based on W3C DID specifications.It supports collaborative services such as distributed and diversified ownership confirmation, identification, and authentication of various entities including individuals, legal entities, objects, and contents. ONT ID establishes a cryptographically-based digital identity for each entity, allowing self-sovereign of data authorization and ownership confirmation, which makes the identity and data truly assets that the user can control. ONT ID has the characteristics of decentralization, self-management, privacy protection, security and ease of use.
* [ontology-ddxf](https://github.com/ontio/ontology-ddxf) - Distributed data eXchange Framework,which allows to build data marketplaces.
  > The downsides of centralized data exchange include data caching, use of data without user authorization and data copyright protection. Ontology is proposing a Distributed Data Protocol (ONT Data). Based on the protocol , we have come up with distributed data exchange framework(DDXF) which allows to customize data trading marketplaces with secured data and financial security. With DDXF, the developer of the ontology ecosystem can easily develop decentralized data application that meets the needs of various scenarios with various features.
* [ontology-eventbus](https://github.com/ontio/ontology-eventbus) - The Go Language Implementation of Ontology Actor Model
  > Actor is a model of parallel computation model in computer science that treats "actors" as the the universal primitives of concurrent computation. In response to a message that it receives, an actor can make local decisions: make local decisions, create more actor, send more messages, and determine how to respond to the next message received.
* [ONTO](https://github.com/ontio/ONTO)
  > ONTO is a comprehensive decentralized client product, which is an entrance of trust search engine and blockchain system.
