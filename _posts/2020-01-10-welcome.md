I grew up with tech, but only got serious about it in early 2017. That's when I started learning about Bitcoin, Blockchain, and everything related. In the following year after having gone down the rabbit-hole, I turned my attention to Self Sovereign Identity.

Inspired by @peacekeeper's [blockchain-identity](https://github.com/peacekeeper/blockchain-identity/) list on GitHub, I began working on my own **curated list of resources related to decentralized identity**.

I saw that decentralized identity has a deep historical context, and saw its potential for being _the_ blockchain use-case, beyond currency. 

From the amount of information spread across the web, but not really indexed well, I knew this community had a need for organization of it's information, and that I could find my way into some profitable ventures doing so.

## Get Involved

In 2018, I connected with Kaliya @identitywoman who has ever been working on similar efforts, to map out the organizations and protocols surrounding decentralized-identity.

She became something of a mentor to me, in this field, and editorial advisor for this site. 

Juan @by_caballero has gotten his hands dirty working on this site and related projects, sometimes assisting in curation. 

A few others have become friends to this effort, even if they haven't physically contributed to the site. Among them [Kyle Den Hartog](https://kyledenhartog.com/) supported some of my early work curating peer-to-peer histories, which may eventually be adapted for this site.

* [Early Internet History](https://bitcoinfo.xyz/history/early-internet/)
* [Peer to Peer rEvolution and Histories](https://bitcoinfo.xyz/peer-to-peer/)

The landscape is moving quickly, and so I'm just filling out and discovering a map of the territory, as able. 

The idea has always been for this to be a collaborative effort, and you are very welcome to participate in the creation of this resource.
