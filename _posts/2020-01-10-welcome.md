## Infominer

In November 2018, Inspired by @peacekeeper's [blockchain-identity](https://github.com/peacekeeper/blockchain-identity/) list, I began working on my own **curated list of resources related to decentralized identity**.

I saw that decentralized identity has a deep historical context, and saw its potential for being _the_ blockchain use-case, beyond currency. 

From the amount of information spread across the web, but not quite accessible to the uninitiated, I knew this community could appreciate aggregation and organization of its information ecosystem.

What began as a single page of links in a Readme file on GitHub, has grown to become the largest web-directory of information related to Self Sovereign Identity.

## Identity Woman

In 2019, I connected with [Kaliya 'Identity Woman' Young](https://identitywoman.net) who has ever been working on similar efforts, to map out the organizations and protocols and leading thought surrounding decentralized-identity. 

During this time, became friends and worked together on a few projects. Kaliya became my guide through the vast web of connections and associations with SSI, and editorial advisor for this site. 

## Identosphere
In October 2020 we launched a reboot of the original identity management feed aggregator [planetidentity.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20161029051802/http://planetidentity.org/). 

The [Identosphere Blog Catcher](https://identosphere.net/) aggregates hundreds of RSS feeds, with pages for personal, business, organization, and web3 blogs.

Once the feed aggregator was established, we began a weekly newsletter called [Identosphere's Weekly Digest](https://newsletter.identosphere.net), using the Blog Catcher as its primary source, along with a weekly twitter search.

## Getting an Upgrade

Now we've sorted over 2 years of content, collected from our newsletter, into this directory. We've also begun upgrading some of the processes by which its stored and generated, cleaned up broken links and outdated content.
