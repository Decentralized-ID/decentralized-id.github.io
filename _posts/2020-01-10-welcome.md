## Infominer

In 2017, Inspired by @peacekeeper's [blockchain-identity](https://github.com/peacekeeper/blockchain-identity/) list, I began working on my own **curated list of resources related to decentralized identity**.

I saw that decentralized identity has a deep historical context, and saw its potential for being _the_ blockchain use-case, beyond currency. 

From the amount of information spread across the web, but not quite accessible to the uninitiated, I knew this community could appreciate aggregation and organization of its information ecosystem.

What began as a single page of links in a Readme file on GitHub, has grown to become the largest web-directory of information related to Self Sovereign Identity.

## Identity Woman

In 2018, I connected with [Kaliya 'Identity Woman' Young](https://identitywoman.net) who has ever been working on similar efforts, to map out the organizations and protocols and leading thought surrounding decentralized-identity.

She became my guide through the vast web of connections and associations with SSI, and editorial advisor for this site. 

## Identosphere
In 2020 we launched a reboot of the original identity management feed aggregator [planetidentity.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20161029051802/http://planetidentity.org/). 

The [Identosphere Blog Catcher](https://identosphere.net/) aggregates hundreds of RSS feeds, with pages for personal, business, organization, and web3 blogs.

Once the feed aggregator was established, we began a weekly newsletter called [Identosphere's Weekly Digest](https://newsletter.identosphere.net), using the Blog Catcher as its primary source, along with a weekly twitter search.

## Getting an Upgrade

Now with over 2 years of content collected in the newsletter, we're sorting that content into this directory, upgrading the processes by which its stored and displayed, and cleaning up any old-outdated content created as I was initially learning and discovering these processes.
